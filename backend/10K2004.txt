General

We have one of the world’s largest copper and gold mining and production operations in terms of reserves
and production. We are also one of the lowest-cost copper producers in the world, after taking into account credits
for related gold and silver production. Our principal asset is the Grasberg minerals district. We discovered the
largest ore body in the district, Grasberg, in 1988. The Grasberg minerals district contains the largest single gold
reserve and the second-largest copper reserves of any mine in the world.

Our principal operating subsidiary is PT Freeport Indonesia, a limited liability company organized under
the laws of the Republic of Indonesia and incorporated as a corporation in Delaware. We own approximately 90.64
percent of PT Freeport Indonesia, and the Government of Indonesia owns the remaining approximate 9.36 percent.
PT Freeport Indonesia mines, processes and explores for ore containing copper, gold and silver. It operates in the
remote highlands of the Sudirman Mountain Range in the province of Papua, Indonesia, which is on the western half
of the island of New Guinea. PT Freeport Indonesia markets its concentrates containing copper, gold and silver
worldwide.

PT Freeport Indonesia conducts its operations pursuant to an agreement, called a Contract of Work, with
the Government of Indonesia (see “Contracts of Work”). The Contract of Work allows us to conduct extensive
mining, production and exploration activities in a 24,700-acre area that we call Block A, which contains the
Grasberg minerals district, and governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes, exchange controls, royalties,
repatriation and other matters. The Contract of Work also allows us to explore for minerals in an approximately
500,000-acre area that we call Block B. Exploration activities in Block B have been suspended in recent years, but
we are currently assessing the possible timing for the resumption of those activities (see “Contracts of Work”). The
term of our Contract of Work expires in 2021, but we can extend it for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesian
government approval, which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably.

Another of our operating subsidiaries, PT Irja Eastern Minerals, which we refer to as Eastern Minerals,
holds an additional Contract of Work in Papua covering approximately 1.2 million acres and conducts exploration
activities, which have been suspended in recent years, under this Contract of Work (see “Contracts of Work”). We
are assessing the possible timing for the resumption of exploration activities in Eastern Minerals’ exploration area.
We have a 100 percent ownership interest in Eastern Minerals.

In 1996, we established joint ventures with Rio Tinto plc, which is an international mining company with
headquarters in London, England. Rio Tinto conducts mining operations in North America, South America, Asia,
Australia, Europe and southern Africa. One of our joint ventures with Rio Tinto covers PT Freeport Indonesia’s
mining operations in Block A. This joint venture gives Rio Tinto, through 2021, a 40 percent interest in certain
assets and in production above specified levels from operations in Block A and, after 2021, a 40 percent interest in
all production in Block A. Under our joint venture arrangements, Rio Tinto also has a 40 percent interest in PT
Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work and Eastern Minerals’ Contract of Work. In addition, Rio Tinto has the
option to participate in 40 percent of any of our other future exploration projects in Papua. To date, Rio Tinto has
elected to participate in all exploration projects, including PT Nabire Bakti Mining.

Under another joint venture agreement through PT Nabire Bakti Mining, we conduct exploration activities,
which have been suspended in recent years (see “Contracts of Work”), in an area covering approximately 500,000
acres in five parcels contiguous to PT Freeport Indonesia’s Block B and one of Eastern Minerals’ blocks. We are
assessing the possible timing for the resumption of exploration activities in PT Nabire Bakti Mining’s exploration
area.
At December 31, 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled
40.5 billion pounds of copper and 46.5 million ounces of gold, all of which are located in Block A. Our
approximate 90.64 percent equity share of these proven and probable recoverable reserves totaled 36.7 billion
pounds of copper and 42.1 million ounces of gold (see “Ore Reserves”). In this annual report, we refer to (1)
aggregate reserves, which means all reserves for the operations we manage, (2) PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of
reserves, which means the reserves net of Rio Tinto’s interest under our joint venture arrangements and which are
the reserves reported as those of our operations in our consolidated financial statements and (3) our equity share of
reserves, which means PT Freeport Indonesia’s share net of the 9.36 percent interest that the Government of
Indonesia owns.

In July 2003, we acquired the 85.7 percent ownership interest in PT Puncakjaya Power owned by affiliates
of Duke Energy Corporation. Puncakjaya Power is the owner of assets supplying power to PT Freeport Indonesia’s
operations, including the 3x65 megawatt coal-fired power facilities (see “Infrastructure”).

We also smelt and refine copper concentrates in Spain and market the refined copper products through our
wholly owned subsidiary, Atlantic Copper, S.A. In addition, PT Freeport Indonesia has a 25 percent interest in PT
Smelting, an Indonesian company that operates a copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia. These smelters
play an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy, as approximately one-half of PT Freeport Indonesia’s
concentrate production has been sold to Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting over the last several years (see
“Investment in Smelters’’).

Contracts of Work

By virtue of their Contracts of Work, PT Freeport Indonesia and Eastern Minerals conduct their current
exploration operations and PT Freeport Indonesia conducts its mining operations in Indonesia. Both Contracts of
Work govern our rights and obligations relating to taxes, exchange controls, royalties, repatriation and other matters.
Both Contracts of Work were concluded pursuant to the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which expresses
Indonesia’s foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against
nationalization, a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of
foreign investors. Specifically, the Contracts of Work provide that the Government of Indonesia will not nationalize
or expropriate PT Freeport Indonesia’s or Eastern Minerals’ mining operations. Any disputes regarding the
provisions of the Contracts of Work are subject to international arbitration. We have experienced no disputes
requiring arbitration during the 37 years we have operated in Indonesia.

PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work covers both Block A, which was first included in a 1967
Contract of Work that was replaced by a new Contract of Work in 1991, and Block B, to which we gained rights in
1991. The initial term of our Contract of Work expires in December 2021, but we can extend it for two 10-year
periods subject to Indonesian government approval, which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. We
originally had the rights to explore 6.5 million acres in Block B, but pursuant to the Contract of Work we have only
retained the rights to approximately 500,000 acres, which we believe, following significant geological assessment,
contain the most promising exploration opportunities.

Eastern Minerals signed its Contract of Work in August 1994. The Contract of Work originally covered
approximately 2.5 million acres. Eastern Minerals' Contract of Work provides for a four-to-seven year exploratory
term and a 30-year term for mining operations. Subject to Indonesian government approval, which cannot be
withheld or delayed unreasonably, we can extend this period for two 10-year periods. Eastern Minerals’ Contract of
Work requires us to relinquish our rights to 25 percent of the original 2.5-million-acre Contract of Work area at the
end of each of three specified periods. As of December 31, 2004, we had relinquished approximately 1.3 million
acres and must relinquish an additional 0.6 million acres at the end of the three-year exploration period, which can
be extended by the Government of Indonesia for as much as two additional years.

We suspended our exploration activities outside of Block A in recent years because of safety and security
issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain
forest areas and an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in forest preservation areas.
In 2001, we requested and received from the Government of Indonesia formal temporary suspensions of our
obligations under the Contracts of Work in all areas outside of Block A. The current suspensions were granted for
one-year periods ending February 26, 2005, for Block B; March 31, 2005, for PT Nabire Bakti Mining; and
November 15, 2004, for Eastern Minerals. Recent Indonesian legislation permits open-pit mining in PT Freeport
Indonesia’s Block B area, subject to certain requirements. We are currently assessing these requirements and
security issues. The timing for our resumption of exploration activities in our Contract of Work areas outside of
Block A depends on the resolution of these matters.

PT Freeport Indonesia pays a copper royalty under its Contact of Work that varies from 1.5 percent of
copper net revenue at a copper price of $0.90 or less per pound to 3.5 percent at a copper price of $1.10 or more per
pound. The Contract of Work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 1.0 percent.

A large part of the mineral royalties under Government of Indonesia regulations are designated to the
provinces from which the minerals are extracted. In connection with our “fourth concentrator mill expansion,” PT
Freeport Indonesia agreed to pay the Government of Indonesia additional royalties (royalties not required by our
Contract of Work) to provide further support to the local governments and the people of Papua. PT Freeport
Indonesia pays the additional royalties on metal from production above 200,000 metric tons of ore per day. The
additional royalty for copper equals the Contract of Work royalty rate and for gold and silver equals twice the
Contract of Work royalty rates. Therefore, our royalty rate on copper net revenues from production above 200,000
metric tons of ore per day is double the Contract of Work royalty rate, and our royalty rates on gold and silver sales
from production above 200,000 metric tons of ore per day are triple the Contract of Work royalty rates. PT Freeport
Indonesia’s share of the combined royalties, including the additional royalties which became effective January 1,
1999, totaled $43.5 million in 2004, $26.5 million in 2003 and $24.5 million in 2002.
Republic of Indonesia

General. The Republic of Indonesia consists of more than 17,000 islands stretching 3,000 miles along the
equator from Malaysia to Australia and is the fourth most populous nation in the world with over 230 million
people. Following many years of Dutch colonial rule, Indonesia gained independence in 1945 and now has a
presidential republic system of government.

Our mining complex was Indonesia’s first copper mining project and was the first major foreign investment
in Indonesia following the economic development program instituted by the Indonesian government in 1967. We
work closely with the central, provincial and local governments in development efforts in the area surrounding our
operations. We have had positive relations with the Indonesian government since we commenced business activities
in Indonesia in 1967, and we intend to continue to maintain positive working relationships with the central,
provincial and local branches of the Indonesian government.

Political Developments. In May 1998, President Suharto, Indonesia’s political leader for more than 30
years, resigned in the wake of an economic crisis in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia and in the face of
growing social unrest. Vice President B.J. Habibie succeeded Suharto. In June 1999, Indonesia held a new
parliamentary election on a generally peaceful basis as the first step in the process of electing a new president. In
October 1999, in accordance with the Indonesian constitution, the country’s highest political institution (the People’s
Consultative Assembly), composed of the newly elected national parliament along with additional provincial and
other representatives, elected Abdurrahman Wahid as president and Megawati Sukarnoputri as vice president.

There were repeated challenges to the political leadership of President Wahid after his election in October
1999. In July 2001, the People’s Consultative Assembly voted to remove President Wahid, and elected Vice
President Megawati Sukarnoputri as president. The 2004 presidential election was conducted peacefully and after a
runoff, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was elected the new president in October.

Recent Developments. On December 26, 2004, a massive earthquake — one of the five strongest ever
recorded — struck off the coast of North Sumatra in Indonesia, triggering powerful tsunamis that devastated the
coastlines of Aceh province in Indonesia and areas of Thailand, India, Sri Lanka and other nations as far away as
Somalia in Africa. The human lives lost are currently estimated to total more than 166,000 in Indonesia alone.
Aceh province, at the western tip of Sumatra, is Indonesia’s westernmost province. Our operations, located 3,000
miles away in Indonesia’s easternmost province of Papua, were not impacted by the tsunamis. PT Freeport
Indonesia has provided cash contributions in Indonesia and FCX, in the United States for immediate assistance and
to encourage fundraising efforts. We also provided airplanes to transport food and medical supplies, aid workers
and government officials to the stricken area, including some of the first aid shipments to arrive, which were
received by President Yudhoyono.

On August 31, 2002, three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of
unidentified assailants. The assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from PT
Freeport Indonesia’s school in Tembagapura, their family members, and other contractors to PT Freeport Indonesia
on the road near Tembagapura, the mining town where the majority of PT Freeport Indonesia’s personnel reside.
Indonesian authorities and the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the incident, which
resulted in the U.S. indictment of an alleged operational commander in the Free Papua Movement/National Freedom
Force.

On October 12, 2002, a bombing killed 202 people in the Indonesian province of Bali, which is 1,500 miles
west of our mining and milling operations. Indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this
bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted. On August 5, 2003, 12 people were killed and over
100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. On
September 9, 2004, 11 people were killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the
Australian embassy. The same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these incidents. Our
mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents. However, our corporate offices in Jakarta
sustained damages as a result of the bombing in front of the Australian embassy. After relocating for several months
our corporate offices in Jakarta were reestablished.

The Government of Indonesia, which provides security for PT Freeport Indonesia’s personnel and operations
(see “Security Matters”), has expressed a strong commitment to protect natural resources businesses operating in
Indonesia, including PT Freeport Indonesia, with heightened security following the incidents discussed above.

7
Economic and Social Conditions. The Indonesian economy grew by an estimated 5 percent in 2004 and 4
percent in 2003. The Indonesian currency, the rupiah, averaged approximately 8,900 rupiah to one U.S. dollar
during 2004 and closed at 9,270 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2004, compared with 8,437 rupiah to
one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2003.

Despite gradual improvements on the economic front, Indonesia’s recovery remains vulnerable to ongoing
political and social tensions. Incidents of violence and separatist pressures continue to be reported. Pro-
independence movements in certain areas continue to be prominent, especially in the province of Aceh, where the
Indonesian government signed a peace agreement with separatists in December 2002, and to a lesser extent in
Papua. Following the December 2004 tsunamis in Aceh, negotiations between the Government of Indonesia and
separatists in Aceh appear more promising. The area surrounding our mining development is sparsely populated by
local people and former residents of more populous areas of Indonesia, some of whom have resettled in Papua under
the Government of Indonesia’s transmigration program. A segment of the local population is opposing Indonesian
rule over Papua, and several separatist groups have sought political independence for the province. In addition to
the August 31, 2002, shooting incident, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but
highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesian military in Papua.

Our Contracts of Work and the Government of Indonesia. While the uncertainties of the regional
autonomy process have created concern among foreign investors, the Indonesian government has repeatedly assured
investors that existing contracts would be honored. Government officials have publicly stated that the Government
of Indonesia will honor existing contracts and that they have no intention of revoking or unilaterally amending such
contracts, specifically including PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work. Our belief that our Contracts of Work
will continue to be honored is further supported by U.S. laws, which prohibit U.S. aid to countries that nationalize
property owned by, or take steps to nullify a contract with, a U.S. citizen or company at least 50 percent owned by
USS. citizens if the foreign country does not within a reasonable time take appropriate steps to provide full value
compensation or other relief under international law.

In July 2004, we received a request from the Indonesian Department of Energy and Mineral Resources that
we offer to sell to Indonesian nationals shares in PT Indocopper Investama at fair market value. PT Indocopper
Investama, which we wholly own, has an approximate 9.36 percent ownership interest in PT Freeport Indonesia. In
response to this request and in view of the potential benefits of having additional Indonesian ownership in our
project, we have agreed to consider a potential sale of an interest in PT Indocopper Investama at fair market value.
Neither our Contract of Work nor Indonesian law requires us to divest any portion of our ownership interest in PT
Freeport Indonesia or PT Indocopper Investama. See “Nusamba Loan Guarantee.”

Our Investment in Indonesia and Papua. We have a board-approved policy statement on social,
employment and human rights, and have comprehensive and extensive social, cultural and community development
programs, to which we have committed significant financial and managerial resources. See “Social Development,
Employment and Human Rights.” These policies and programs are designed to address the impact of our operations
on the local villages and people and to provide assistance for the development of the local people. While we believe
these efforts should serve to avoid damage to and disruptions of our mining operations, our operations could be
damaged or disrupted by social, economic and political forces beyond our control.

PT Freeport Indonesia contributes to the economies of Papua and the Republic of Indonesia through the
payment of taxes, dividends and royalties; voluntary economic development programs; infrastructure development;
employment; and the purchase of local and national goods. In fact, PT Freeport Indonesia has frequently been one
of the largest taxpayers in the Republic of Indonesia. In addition, it pays royalties on all minerals removed from the
ground.

Since it began development activities more than 35 years ago, PT Freeport Indonesia has made significant
investments in infrastructure both for its use and for use by the Papuan public. These infrastructure improvements
include medical facilities, roads, an airport and heliports, schools, housing, community buildings and places of
worship.

PT Freeport Indonesia is also one of the largest private employers in Indonesia and by far the largest in
Papua. As of December 31, 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia directly employed 7,858 people; and 6,247 contract
workers provided services to PT Freeport Indonesia. In addition, 4,587 persons worked for privatized companies
providing services within PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations area.

8
Besides the estimated $2.6 billion paid in direct benefits to the Indonesian government under the Contract
of Work from 1992 through 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations have provided another $9.3 billion during this
period in indirect benefits to Papua and the Republic of Indonesia in the form of wages and benefits paid to workers,
purchases of goods and services, charitable contributions and reinvestments in operations. For 2004, direct benefits
totaled approximately $260 million and indirect benefits totaled approximately $623 million.

Ore Reserves

During 2004, additions to the aggregate proven and probable reserves of the Grasberg and other Block A
ore bodies in the Grasberg minerals district totaled approximately 141 million metric tons of ore representing
increases of 2.9 billion recoverable pounds of copper, 2.2 million recoverable ounces of gold and 18.9 million
recoverable ounces of silver. The additions were primarily the result of positive drilling results at the Deep Mill
Level Zone ore body, a 146-million-metric-ton ore body. Year-end aggregate proven and probable recoverable
reserves, net of 2004 production, were 2.8 billion metric tons of ore averaging 1.09 percent copper, 0.97 grams per
metric ton (g/t) of gold and 3.84 g/t of silver representing 56.2 billion pounds of copper, 61.0 million ounces of gold
and 174.5 million ounces of silver. Our aggregate exploration budget for 2005, including Rio Tinto’s share, is
expected to total approximately $21 million ($15 million for our share) with most of the effort focused on testing the
Mill Level Zone and Deep Mill Level Zone deposits to the northwest, expansion of the underground Grasberg
resource, and testing reconnaissance targets along the Wanagon and Idenberg fault trends.

Pursuant to joint venture arrangements between PT Freeport Indonesia and Rio Tinto, Rio Tinto has a 40
percent interest in production from reserves above those reported at December 31, 1994. Net of Rio Tinto’s share,
PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of proven and probable recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2004, was 40.5
billion pounds of copper, 46.5 million ounces of gold and 124.5 million ounces of silver. FCX’s equity interest in
proven and probable recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2004, was 36.7 billion pounds of copper, 42.1 million
ounces of gold and 112.8 million ounces of silver. We estimated recoverable reserves using an average copper price
of $0.85 per pound and an average gold price of $270 per ounce. If metal prices were adjusted to the approximate
average London spot prices for the past three years, i.e., copper prices adjusted from $0.85 per pound to $0.94 per
pound and gold prices adjusted from $270 per ounce to $361 per ounce, the additions to proven and probable
reserves would not be material to our reported reserves.

All of our proven and probable recoverable reserves lie within Block A. The Grasberg minerals district
contains the largest single gold reserve and the second-largest copper reserves of any mine in the world. Aggregate
Grasberg open pit and underground proven and probable recoverable ore reserves as of December 31, 2004, are
shown below along with those of our other deposits. Reserve calculations were prepared by our employees under
the supervision of George D. MacDonald, our Vice President of Exploration, and were reviewed and verified by
Independent Mining Consultants, Inc., experts in mining, geology and reserve determination. See “Risk Factors.”
We developed our current mine plan based on completing the mining of all of our currently designated recoverable
reserves before the end of 2041, which would be the expiration of our Contract of Work including two 10-year
extensions. Prior to the expiration of the initial term of our Contract of Work in December 2021, under our current
mine plan we expect to mine approximately 47 percent of aggregate proven and probable ore, representing
approximately 55 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 69
percent of PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of recoverable gold reserves.

In defining its open-pit reserves, PT Freeport Indonesia applies an “economic cutoff grade” strategy. The
objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of its operations. PT Freeport Indonesia uses a break-

even cutoff grade to define the insitu reserves for its underground ore bodies. The break-even cutoff grade is

defined for a metric ton of ore, as that equivalent copper grade, once produced and sold, that generates sufficient
revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with its production.

PT Freeport Indonesia’s ores contain three recoverable metals; copper, gold and silver. We value all three
metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single break-even cutoff grade. Copper equivalent
percentage is used to express the relative value of multi-metal ores in terms of one metal, in this case, copper. The

calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities, metals prices as

used for reserve determination, recovery rates, treatment charges and royalties. The table below shows the break-
even cutoff grade, expressed as a copper equivalent percentage, for each of our existing ore bodies as of December

31, 2004.

The following table sets forth the average drill hole spacing for each of our ore bodies. Drill hole spacing
data is used by mining professionals, such as mining engineers, in determining the suitability of data coverage (on a
relative basis) in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the
resource estimate. Drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish confidence level for
resource classification. Drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support
the level of confidence in results that fit a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit. We calculated the
average drill hole spacing within each ore body using the distance from the center of each block in the resource
model to the nearest drill hole composite. We then calculated the averages of these values within the volume of
each ore body and reported them under the column entitled ““Average Distance: To Nearest Sample.” This value
represents at least one-half of the average drill hole spacing within each deposit. We calculated the value under the
column entitled “Average Distance: Between Drill Holes” by multiplying the average minimum distance value by
two, and this value represents the maximum average drill hole spacing.

Mining Operations — Mines in Production
We and our predecessors have conducted exploration and mining operations in Block A since 1967 and

have been the only operator of these operations. We currently have two mines in operation: the Grasberg open pit
and the Deep Ore Zone.

11
We began open-pit mining of the Grasberg ore body in 1990. Open-pit operations are expected to continue
until 2015 at which time the Grasberg underground mining operations are scheduled to begin. Production is
currently at the 3,520- to 4,060-meter elevation level and totaled 48.9 million metric tons of ore in 2004 and 57.4
million metric tons of ore in 2003, which provided 76 percent or our 2004 mill feed and 77 percent of our 2003 mill
feed. Our open-pit mining rate, including ore and overburden, totaled 592,700 metric tons per day in 2004 and
598,800 metric tons per day in 2003. Annual production rates are expected to range between 600,000 metric tons
per day and 750,000 metric tons per day through 2010 and then decline through 2015. The Grasberg open pit is
fully developed and we do not expect to incur any significant development costs other than our deferred mining
costs discussed below.

The current Grasberg equipment fleet consists of over 800 pieces of equipment. As of December 31, 2004,
the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes 150 haul trucks with payloads ranging
from 135 metric tons to 290 metric tons, 17 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 cubic meters to 42 cubic
meters and 58 bulldozers and graders. We believe our current equipment level is adequate to meet our projected
production levels over the remaining life of the pit.

In addition to the mining equipment, Grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and
provide the capacity to transport up to 225,000 metric tons per day of Grasberg ore to the mill and 135,000 metric
tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles.

Mining costs are charged to operations as incurred. However, because of the configuration and
location of the Grasberg open-pit ore body and the location and extent of the related surrounding
overburden, the ratio of overburden to ore is much higher in the initial mining of the open pit than in later
years. As a result, surface mining costs associated with overburden removal at PT Freeport Indonesia’s
Grasberg open-pit mine that are estimated to relate to future production are initially deferred when the ratio
of actual overburden removed to ore mined exceeds the estimated average ratio of overburden removed to
ore mined over the life of the Grasberg open-pit mine. Those deferred costs are subsequently charged to
operating costs when the ratio of actual overburden removed to ore mined falls below the estimated average
ratio of overburden to ore over the life of the Grasberg open-pit mine. The reserve quantities used to
develop the life of mine ratio are the proven and probable ore quantities for the Grasberg open pit shown
above.

The application of the deferred mining cost method has resulted in an asset on FCX’s balance
sheets (“Deferred Mining Costs”), which based on current mine plans, is estimated to increase through
about 2010. Subsequently, these costs are expected to be amortized as a charge to production and delivery
costs until they are fully amortized at the end of the open pit’s life, which is estimated to be in
approximately 2015. This is because PT Freeport Indonesia expects to mine higher than average amounts
of overburden through 2010 and less than average thereafter. Deferred mining costs totaled $220.4 million
at December 31, 2004, and $142.6 million at December 31, 2003. Additions to deferred mining costs are
classified as increases in deferred mining costs in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash
flows and totaled $77.8 million in 2004, $64.4 million in 2003 and $30.6 million in 2002. See Note 1 of
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in our 2004 Annual Report incorporated herein by
reference.

The Deep Ore Zone ore body lies vertically below the now depleted Intermediate Ore Zone. We began
production from the Deep Ore Zone ore body in 1989, but we suspended production in 1991 in favor of production
from the Grasberg deposit. Production using the block-cave method restarted in September 2000. Production is at
the 3,110-meter elevation level and totaled 15.9 million metric tons of ore in 2004 and 14.8 million metric tons of
ore in 2003. The Deep Ore Zone has performed above design capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day and we
are expanding the Deep Ore Zone operation to sustained production of 50,000 metric tons of ore per day with the
installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation. Production from the Deep Ore Zone averaged 43,600
metric tons of ore per day in 2004 and 40,500 metric tons of ore per day in 2003.

The Deep Ore Zone mine fleet consists of over 160 pieces of mobile equipment. The primary mining
equipment directly associated with production and development includes 26 load-haul-dump (LHD) units and 15
haul trucks. Our LHD units typically carry approximately 11 metric tons of ore. The units dump into a gyratory
crusher and ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles.

12
During 2004 at the Deep Ore Zone mine, we completed 9,550 meters of development drifting in support of
the block-cave mining method and the ongoing expansion to 50,000 metric tons of ore per day. The expansion to
50,000 metric tons of ore per day is expected to be completed in 2007 with aggregate development costs from 2004
through 2007 to total approximately $62 million (approximately $37 million for PT Freeport Indonesia’s share).

Our development costs include costs incurred resulting from mine pre-production activities undertaken to
gain access to proven and probable reserves including adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and
removal of overburden. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets is determined using the unit-of-
production method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves. Development costs that
relate to a specific ore body are depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable
proven and probable copper reserves for the ore body benefited. PT Freeport Indonesia’s total development costs at
December 31, 2004 for the Deep Ore Zone mine, currently our only operating underground mine, totaled $189.5
million, which are being depreciated on a unit-of-production basis over the life of the Deep Ore Zone proven and
probable reserves. See Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in our 2004 Annual Report
incorporated herein by reference.

The majority of maintenance activities is performed on site by a combination of PT Freeport Indonesia
employees and contract workers. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 7,500 employees and contract
workers directly involved in Grasberg open-pit and Deep Ore Zone underground mining, milling and ore flow
operations.

The Intermediate Ore Zone was an underground block-cave operation that began production in the first half
of 1994. The Intermediate Ore Zone was depleted during the third quarter of 2003. Production totaled 2.5 million
metric tons of ore in 2003 and 7.1 million metric tons of ore in 2002. During its 10-year life, the Intermediate Ore
Zone operation produced almost 30 percent more copper and gold than the initial reserve estimates.

Our principal source of power for all our operations is a coal-fired power plant that we built in conjunction
with our fourth concentrator expansion (see “Infrastructure”). Medium-speed diesel generators supply peaking and
backup power. A combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground
operations provides water for our operations. The average annual rainfall in the project area is 180 inches.

Mining Operations — Mines in Development

Seven other ore bodies, referred to as the underground Grasberg, Kucing Liar, Mill Level Zone, Deep Mill
Level Zone, Ertsberg Stockwork Zone, Big Gossan and the Dom are located in Block A. These ore bodies are at
various stages of development, and are included in our proven and probable recoverable reserves. We incurred $2.9
million for mine development, expansion and infrastructure capital expenditures related to these ore bodies and
$26.7 million for common underground infrastructure during the three years ended December 31, 2004. See “Risk
Factors.”

The underground Grasberg reserves will be mined using the block-cave method at the end of open-pit
mining, which is expected to continue until approximately 2015. The Kucing Liar ore body lies on the southern
flank of and underneath the southern portion of the Grasberg open pit at the 2,600- to 3,200-meter elevation level.
We are reviewing development plans for Kucing Liar.

The Mill Level Zone ore body lies directly below the Deep Ore Zone mine at the 2,900-meter elevation.
The Deep Mill Level Zone ore body lies beneath the Mill Level Zone ore body at the 2,600-meter elevation. This
ore represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the Ertsberg East Skarn system and neighboring
Ertsberg porphyry. Drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of these ore bodies. We expect to mine the Mill
Level Zone ore body using a block-cave method after we complete mining at the Deep Ore Zone ore body. Near the
end of mining the Mill Level Zone ore body, we expect to mine the Deep Mill Level Zone ore body also using a
block-cave method.

The Ertsberg Stockwork Zone ore body extends off the southwest side of the Deep Ore Zone ore body at

the 3,100- to 3,600-meter elevation level. Drilling efforts continue to determine the extent of this ore body, which
we expect to mine using a block-cave method starting in about 2009.

13
The Big Gossan ore body is located approximately 1,000 meters southwest of the original Ertsberg open-pit
deposit. We began the initial underground development of the ore body in 1993 when we drove tunnels from the
mill area into the ore zone at the 2,600-meter elevation level. A stope and fill mining method will be used on the
Big Gossan deposit. A feasibility study and an update to the site-wide development plan will be completed in 2005
to determine is the timing of initial production, currently projected to be 2007.

The Dom ore body lies approximately 1,500 meters southeast of the depleted Ertsberg open-pit deposit.
Production at the open-pit portion of the ore body will begin after completion of open-pit mining at Grasberg,
subsequently followed by block-cave mining of the underground portion of the Dom ore body.

The projected aggregate capital expenditures required to reach full production capacity for each of our
undeveloped ore bodies based on our latest mine plans and our proven and probable recoverable reserves as of
December 31, 2004, are shown below (in millions). Actual costs could differ materially from these estimates as we
will not incur most of the expenditures for several years and we will incur them over a period of several years.
Based on our current estimates, we expect aggregate expenditures will range between $25 million and $265 million
annually, during the next 15 years. In addition, these costs will be shared with Rio Tinto in accordance with our
joint venture agreement.

Description of Ore Bodies. Our ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions, the
Grasberg monzodiorite and the Ertsberg diorite. The host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and
clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the Sudirman Range, and the igneous rocks of monzonitic
to dioritic composition that intrude them. The igneous-hosted ore bodies (the Grasberg open pit and block cave, and
the Ertsberg Stockwork Zone block cave) occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulphides,
dominated by chalcopyrite and, to a much lesser extent, bornite. The sedimentary-rock hosted ore bodies occur as
“magnetite-rich, calctum/magnesian skarn” replacements, whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by
major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions.

The copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is also dominated by chalcopyrite, but higher bornite
concentrations are common. Moreover, gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district’s ore bodies,
though rarely visible to the naked eye. These gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper
sulphide minerals, though, in some deposits, these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite.

The following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing each of our ore bodies and
the years in which we currently expect that production of each ore body will begin and end. Production volumes are
typically lower in the first few years of each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps
up to full production. Currently, the Grasberg open pit and Deep Ore Zone are our only producing mines. The
ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors,
including the results of our exploration efforts, and may vary from the dates shown below. In addition, we develop
our mine plans for the Grasberg open pit and underground mines based on maximizing the net present value from
the ore bodies.

During 2004, we mined an average of 636,200 metric tons of material per day, including ore and
overburden, and we do not require any additional approvals for higher rates. During 2003, we mined an average of
646,100 metric tons of material per day. The following chart illustrates our current aggregate mill capacity; our
aggregate permitted mill capacity; and our projected milling rates. The decline in milling rates in 2016 reflects the
expected completion date of open-pit mining at the Grasberg ore body. We are continuing to develop mine plans to
optimize production levels and to offset the anticipated decline in 2016.

Milling and Production

The ore from our mines moves by a conveyor system to a series of shafts through which it drops to our
milling and concentrating complex located approximately 2,900 meters above sea level. At the mill, the ore is
crushed and ground and mixed in tanks with water and small amounts of flotation reagents where it is continuously
agitated with air. During this physical separation process, copper-, gold- and silver-bearing particles rise to the top
of the tanks and are collected and thickened into a concentrate. The concentrate leaves the mill complex as a slurry,
consisting of approximately 65 percent solids by weight, and is pumped through three parallel 115-kilometer
pipelines to our coastal port site facility at Amamapare where it is filtered, dried and stored for shipping. Ships are
loaded at dock facilities at the port until they draw their maximum dock-side water, and they then move to deeper
water, where loading is completed from shuttling barges.

Our production results for the last three years are as follows:

In October 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg open pit and in December
2003, a smaller debris flow occurred in the same section. The area affected by the slippage events included two
active mining areas which were scheduled to be mined in the fourth quarter of 2003 (see “Grasberg Open-Pit
Slippage”). Mill throughput and production in 2003 and 2004 were negatively affected by PT Freeport Indonesia’s
efforts to accelerate removal of overburden material and restore safe access to higher-grade areas in the pit. Mill
throughput averaged 185,100 metric tons of ore per day in 2004, a nine percent decrease from the 203,000 metric
tons average in 2003. Copper and gold production was lower in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the lower mill
throughput and lower average ore grades. Copper production for 2004 totaled 1.0 billion pounds, 295.1 million
pounds lower than 2003 production. Gold production for 2004 totaled 1.46 million ounces, 1.0 million ounces lower
than 2003 production. The lower sales volumes and the primarily fixed nature of a large portion of PT Freeport
Indonesia’s cost structure resulted in average net cash production costs for 2004 increasing to $0.40 per pound
compared with a net credit of $0.02 per pound for 2003.

Copper production for 2003 was 1.3 billion pounds, 232.6 million pounds lower than 2002 production
primarily because of lower average copper ore grades and lower mill throughput caused by the slippage and debris
flow events. Gold production for 2003 was 166,500 ounces higher than that for 2002 primarily because of higher
average gold grades.

Average net cash production costs per pound of copper of a net credit of $(0.02) for 2003 were an annual
record low compared with $0.08 for 2002. Higher gold credits in 2003 offset higher site production and delivery
costs. Our average net cash production costs per pound of copper vary with the amount of gold we sell and gold
prices, among other factors. Once we complete our open-pit mining operations at the Grasberg mine in
approximately 2015 and transition to underground, we expect our share of annual copper and gold production to be
lower than current levels, and all other factors being equal, our average net cash production costs to increase. For
more information regarding our operating and financial results, see our 2004 Annual Report incorporated herein by
reference.

Geotechnical Programs

Our geotechnical programs support several phases of the operations, including our open-pit mine (pit slope
and overburden stockpile stability), our underground mine, our infrastructure and our tailings management program.
For information regarding our tailings management program, see “Environmental Matters.”

A group of our senior level employees has the responsibility, authority and oversight for our overall
geotechnical programs. Our multi-disciplinary approach combines in-house personnel with backgrounds in civil,
geotechnical, mining engineering, geology and hydrology to form a technical services group that reports to our
senior managers. Our technical services group develops information that our mine engineering group uses to
develop mine and stockpile designs, production schedules and related plans. Our technical services group also
monitors slope stability and other geotechnical and hydrological developments.

Our technical services group is composed of expatriates and Indonesian nationals, who are university
educated. International consulting experts in each of the applicable technical fields support this group. In-house
training provided by consultants as well as off-site seminars and industry conferences supports the training of our
staff. Our joint venture partner has also provided geotechnical and engineering support to our operations.
Consultants and our joint venture partner provide input into program development and assess performance of these
critical roles.

Our technical services group uses information from geological drilling for the development and updating of
our geological, geotechnical and hydrologic models. We develop computer-based geologic models for mine design
and dewatering programs. We provide continuous ground and slope monitoring in our mines, on all overburden
stockpiles, and around all infrastructure using various computerized and automated systems. We also daily inspect
all open-pit working areas, with any items of concern being reported to our senior managers. Our hydrology
function measures and tracks water flow patterns to determine the effectiveness and need for de-watering and
depressurization programs. We drain all surface flows away from the open pit and pump any in-pit surface water to
dedicated drain holes connected to our underground de-watering drift system. We also continuously monitor rainfall
at our operations so that we may adjust for operational impacts and safety considerations.

Grasberg Open-Pit Slippage

On October 9, 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg open pit. Eight workers
perished and five workers were injured in the incident. The area affected by the slippage, comprising approximately
five percent of the surface area of the massive Grasberg pit, included two active mining areas that were scheduled to
be mined in 2003 and 2004. On December 12, 2003, a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose
material occurred in the same area of the Grasberg open pit resulting in only minor property damage. Following
these two events, PT Freeport Indonesia redirected its open-pit operations to accelerate removal of waste material
from the south wall to restore safe access to the higher-grade ore areas in the pit. These activities resulted in
reduced production levels. In April 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia established safe access and initiated mining in
higher-grade ore areas while continuing waste removal activities. PT Freeport Indonesia resumed normal milling
rates in June 2004.

As a result of the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events, PT Freeport Indonesia notified its
copper concentrate customers that it was declaring force majeure under the terms of its contracts as it would be
unable to satisfy its annual sales and delivery commitments. In December 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia terminated
the force majeure that had been in effect since December 2003 under its concentrate sales contracts.

PT Freeport Indonesia maintains property damage and business interruption insurance related to its
operations. In December 2004, we entered into an insurance settlement agreement and settled all claims that arose
from the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events in the Grasberg open-pit mine. PT Freeport
Indonesia’s insurers agreed to pay an aggregate of $125.0 million in connection with its claims. After considering
our joint venture partner’s interest in the proceeds, PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of proceeds totaled $95.0 million.

Exploration

As a result of our joint venture arrangements, Rio Tinto generally pays for 40 percent of our joint venture
exploration and exploratory drilling costs in Papua. The joint ventures incurred total exploration costs of $13.6
million in 2004 and $10.5 million in 2003. The joint ventures’ exploration budget for 2005 totals approximately $21
million with most of the effort focused on testing the Mill Level Zone and Deep Mill Level Zone deposits to the
northwest, expansion of the underground Grasberg resource, and testing reconnaissance targets along the Wanagan
and Idenberg fault trends.

In June 1998, we entered into a joint venture agreement to conduct exploration activities in PT Nabire
Bakti Mining’s Contract of Work area, which currently covers approximately 500,000 acres in several blocks
contiguous to PT Freeport Indonesia’s Block B and one of Eastern Minerals’ blocks in Papua. Rio Tinto shares in
40 percent of our interest and costs in this exploration joint venture. We and Rio Tinto can earn up to a 62 percent
interest in the PT Nabire Bakti Mining Contract of Work by spending up to $21 million on exploration and other
activities in the joint venture areas. We have spent $17.0 million through December 31, 2004.

With the subsequent approval of the Indonesian government, in 2000 we suspended our field exploration
activities in Block B, which includes the Wabu Ridge gold prospect, as well as in the other Contract of Work areas
of Eastern Minerals and PT Nabire Bakti Mining. The suspensions are due to safety and security issues and
regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest
areas and an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in forest preservation areas. All
of the suspended areas are outside of our current mining operations area. We are assessing the possible timing for
resumption of our exploration activities.

Infrastructure

The location of our mining operations in a remote area requires that our operations be virtually self-
sufficient. In addition to the mining facilities described above, in the course of the development of our project we
have constructed ourselves or participated with others in the construction of an airport, a port, a 119 kilometer road,
an aerial tramway, two hospitals and related medical facilities, and two town sites with housing, schools and other
facilities sufficient to support more than 17,000 persons.

In 1996, we completed a significant infrastructure program, which includes various residential, community
and commercial facilities. We designed the program to provide the infrastructure needed for our operations, to
enhance the living conditions of our employees, and to develop and promote the growth of local and other third
party activities and enterprises in Papua. We have developed the facilities through joint ventures or direct
ownership involving local Indonesian interests and other investors.

In July 2003, we acquired the 85.7 percent ownership interest in Puncakjaya Power owned by affiliates of
Duke Energy Corporation for $68.1 million cash, net of $9.9 million of cash acquired. Puncakjaya Power is the
owner of assets supplying power to PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations, including the 3x65 megawatt coal-fired
power facilities. PT Freeport Indonesia purchases power from Puncakjaya Power under infrastructure asset
financing arrangements. At December 31, 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia had infrastructure asset financing
obligations to Puncakjaya Power totaling $258.7 million. As a result of our acquisition of the 85.7 percent
ownership interest, our consolidated balance sheet no longer reflects PT Freeport Indonesia’s obligation to
Puncakjaya Power, but instead reflects the Puncakjaya Power bank debt which totaled $187.0 million and a
receivable from Rio Tinto totaling $73.5 million for its share of the obligation to Puncakjaya Power at December 31,
2004.

Marketing

PT Freeport Indonesia sells its copper concentrates, which contain significant quantities of gold and silver,
under United States dollar-denominated sales agreements, mostly to companies in Asia and Europe and to
international trading companies. We sell substantially all of our budgeted production of copper concentrates under
long-term contracts with selling prices based on world metals prices (generally the London Metal Exchange
settlement prices for Grade A copper). Under these contracts, initial billing occurs at the time of shipment and final
settlement on the copper portion is generally based on average prices for a specified future period. Gold generally is
sold at the average London Bullion Market Association price for a specified month near the month of shipment.

20
Revenues from concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties (see “Contracts of Work’), treatment and
refining charges (including participation charges, if applicable, based on the market prices of metals), and the impact
of derivative financial instruments, if any, used to hedge against risks from metals price fluctuations. Moreover,
because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process,
our revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these
unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of our contracts and vary by customer. Treatment
and refining charges represent payments to smelters and refiners and are either fixed or in certain cases vary with the
price of copper. We sell a small amount of copper concentrates in the spot market. See “Risk Factors.”

We have commitments, including commitments from Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting, for essentially all
of our estimated 2005 production. We estimate our share of sales for 2005 to approximate 1.5 billion pounds of
copper and 2.9 million ounces of gold. Projected 2005 copper and gold sales reflect the expectation of higher
production following completion of efforts to restore safe access to high-grade ore areas in the Grasberg open pit.
See “Risk Factors.”

PT Freeport Indonesia has a long-term contract through 2007 to provide Atlantic Copper with a quantity of
copper concentrates at market prices which currently approximates 60 percent of Atlantic Copper’s annual copper
concentrate requirements. PT Freeport Indonesia’s agreement with PT Smelting provides, for the life of PT Freeport
Indonesia’s mines, for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements necessary to produce
205,000 metric tons of copper (essentially the Gresik smelter’s original design capacity) on a priority basis. In 2004,
PT Smelting increased its stated production capacity to 250,000 metric tons of copper per year. For the first 15
years of PT Smelting’s commercial operations beginning December 1998, PT Freeport Indonesia agreed that the
treatment and refining charges on specified quantities of the concentrate PT Freeport Indonesia supplies will not fall
below specified minimum rates, subject to renegotiation in 2008. The rate was $0.23 per pound, during the period
from the commencement of PT Smelting’s operations in 1998 until April 3, 2004 when it declined to a minimum of
$0.21 per pound. We anticipate that PT Freeport Indonesia will sell approximately 50 percent of its annual
concentrate production to Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting. In 2004, the percentage of concentrate PT Freeport
Indonesia sold to Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting was closer to 60 percent because of reduced production levels
following the Grasberg slippage events and PT Freeport Indonesia’s commitments to provide PT Smelting with
concentrate on a priority basis. A summary of PT Freeport Indonesia’s aggregate percentage concentrate sales to its
affiliates and to other parties for the last three years follows:

2004 2003 2002

PT Smelting 40% 30% 26%
Atlantic Copper 19% 25% 24%
Other parties 41% 45% 50%

100% 100% 100%

Investment in Smelters

Our investment in smelters (Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting) serves an important role in our concentrate
marketing strategy. PT Freeport Indonesia generally sells approximately one-half of its concentrate production to its
affiliated smelters, Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting, and the remainder to other customers. Treatment charges for
smelting and refining copper concentrates represent a cost to PT Freeport Indonesia and income to Atlantic Copper
and PT Smelting. Through downstream integration, we are assured placement of a significant portion of our
concentrate production. While low smelting and refining charges in recent years adversely affected the operating
results of Atlantic Copper, they benefited the operating results of PT Freeport Indonesia’s mining operations,
effectively achieving a hedge for these charges.

Atlantic Copper, S.A. We own 100 percent of Atlantic Copper. Atlantic Copper completed the last
expansion of its production capacity in 1997 and its smelter currently has a design capacity of 290,000 metric tons
of copper per year. We have no present plans to expand Atlantic Copper’s production capacity. During 2004,
Atlantic Copper treated 768,100 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 224,300 metric tons of new
copper anodes. During 2003, Atlantic Copper treated 964,400 metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced
290,300 metric tons of new copper anodes. Atlantic Copper completed a 51-day scheduled major maintenance
turnaround in May 2004, adversely affecting 2004 results. Major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically
occur approximately every nine years for Atlantic Copper, with significantly shorter-term maintenance turnarounds
occurring in the interim. Atlantic Copper purchased approximately 27 percent of its 2004 concentrate requirements
from PT Freeport Indonesia at market prices. Atlantic Copper has experienced no material operating problems, and
we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at Atlantic Copper.

21
We contributed $202.0 million to Atlantic Copper in 2004, $10.0 million in 2003 and $25.0 million in
2002. In addition, we loaned $189.5 million to Atlantic Copper in 2004. The funds were used to improve Atlantic
Copper’s financial structure during its major maintenance turnaround and during a period of extremely low
treatment and refining charge rates, which have negatively affected Atlantic Copper’s results. Our total investment
in Atlantic Copper through December 31, 2004, was $456.9 million.

PT Smelting. PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work required us to construct or cause to be constructed
a smelter in Indonesia if we and the Indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically
viable. In 1995, following the completion of a feasibility study, we entered into agreements relating to the formation
of PT Smelting and the construction of the copper smelter in Gresik, Indonesia.

PT Smelting is a joint venture among PT Freeport Indonesia, Mitsubishi Materials Corporation, Mitsubishi
Corporation and Nippon Mining & Metals Co., Ltd., which own 25 percent, 60.5 percent, 9.5 percent and 5 percent,
respectively, of the outstanding PT Smelting common stock. In accordance with the joint venture agreements, PT
Freeport Indonesia provides the majority of PT Smelting’s copper concentrate requirements. In December 2003, PT
Smelting’s shareholder agreement was amended to eliminate PT Freeport Indonesia’s assignment of its earnings in
PT Smelting to support a 13 percent cumulative annual return to the other owners for the first 20 years of operations.
No amounts were paid under this assignment. PT Freeport Indonesia’s total investment in PT Smelting through
December 31, 2004, was $98.7 million.

During 2004, PT Smelting treated 758,100 metric tons of concentrate and produced 211,600 metric tons of
new copper anodes. During 2003, PT Smelting treated 824,800 metric tons of concentrate and produced 247,400
metric tons of new copper anodes. PT Smelting completed a 31-day major maintenance turnaround in the second
quarter of 2004. Major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every four years for
PT Smelting, with significantly shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. PT Smelting has experienced
no material operating problems and we are not aware of any potential material environmental liabilities at PT
Smelting.

Competition

We compete with other mining companies in the sale of our mineral concentrates and the recruitment and
retention of qualified personnel. Some competing companies possess financial resources greater than ours and
possess multiple mining assets less geographically concentrated in a single area than ours. We believe, however,
that we are one of the lowest-cost copper producers in the world, after taking into account credits for related gold
and silver production, which gives us a significant competitive advantage.

Social Development, Employment and Human Rights

We have a social, employment and human rights policy designed to result in our operating in compliance
with the laws in the areas of our operations, and in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the
people who are indigenous to the area. We continue to incur significant costs on social and cultural activities,
primarily in Papua. These activities include:

¢ comprehensive job training programs;

e basic education programs;

e several public health programs, including extensive malaria control;

e agricultural assistance programs;

e a business incubator program to encourage the local people to establish their own small scale
businesses;

e cultural preservation programs; and

e charitable donations.

In 1996, PT Freeport Indonesia agreed to commit at least one percent of its revenues to the Freeport
Partnership Fund for Community Development (formerly the Freeport Fund for Irian Jaya Development) to support
village-based health, education, economic and social development programs in its area of operations. This
commitment replaced our community development programs in which we spent a similar amount of money each
year. Our contributions totaled $17.5 million in 2004, $17.4 million in 2003 and $15.2 million in 2002 to the
Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development.

22
Lembaga Pembangunan Masyarakat Amungme Kamoro (LPMAK) oversees disbursement of the funds we
contribute to the fund. LPMAK’s board of commissioners is made up of a leader of the Amungme people, a leader
of the Kamoro people, leaders of the three local churches, a representative of the local government and a
representative of PT Freeport Indonesia.

We believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the
local villages and people and should help us to avoid disruptions of mining operations. Nevertheless, social and
political instability in the area may adversely impact our mining operations. See “Risk Factors.”

In December 2000, we endorsed the joint U.S. State Department-British Foreign Office Voluntary
Principles on Human Rights and Security. Several major natural resources companies and important human rights
organizations also endorsed the Voluntary Principles. We participated in drafting these principles with all of the
parties involved and incorporated them into our social and human rights policy.

Security Matters

Consistent with our Contract of Work and duty to protect our employees and property, we have taken
appropriate steps to provide a safe and secure working environment. As part of its security program, PT Freeport
Indonesia maintains its own internal security department, which performs functions such as protecting company
facilities, monitoring the shipment of company goods through the airport and terminal, assisting in traffic control
and aiding rescue operations. PT Freeport Indonesia’s civilian security employees (numbering about 700) are
unarmed and perform duties consistent with their internal security role. PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of costs for
its internal civilian security department totaled $12.3 million for 2004, $11.2 million for 2003 and $7.7 million for
2002. The security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her
compliance with our human rights policy.

PT Freeport Indonesia, and all businesses and residents of Indonesia, relies on the Government of Indonesia
for the provision of public order, upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property. The
Grasberg mine has been designated by the Government of Indonesia as one of Indonesia’s vital national assets. This
designation results in the military’s playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations. The
Government of Indonesia is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations.

From the outset of PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations, the government has looked to PT Freeport Indonesia
to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited
resources of the Indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in Papua. PT Freeport
Indonesia’s financial support for the Indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area
represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property, better ensuring that personnel
are properly fed and lodged, and have the logistical resources to patrol PT Freeport Indonesia’s roads and secure its
operating area. In addition, provision of such support and oversight is consistent with PT Freeport Indonesia’s
obligations under the Contract of Work, reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship, and is in
keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights, which include our endorsement of
the joint U.S. State Department-British Foreign Office Voluntary Principles on Human Rights and Security.

PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of support costs for the government-provided security, involving over 2,400
Indonesian government security personnel currently located in the general area of our operations, was $6.9 million
for 2004, $5.9 million for 2003 and $5.6 million for 2002. This supplemental support consists of various
infrastructure and other costs, such as food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs, allowances to cover incidental and
administrative costs, and community assistance programs conducted by the military/police. PT Freeport Indonesia’s
capital costs for associated infrastructure was $0.2 million for 2004, $0.6 million for 2003 and $0.4 million for 2002.

Environmental Matters

We have a board-approved environmental policy that commits us not only to compliance with applicable
federal, state and local environmental statutes and regulations, but also to continuous improvement of our
environmental performance at every operational site. We believe that we conduct our Indonesian operations
pursuant to all necessary permits and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable Indonesian
environmental laws, rules and regulations. Additionally, the environmental management systems for our PT
Freeport Indonesia mining and milling operations and our Atlantic Copper smelting operations are ISO
(International Standardization Organization) 14001 certified.

23
Mining operations on the scale of our operations in Papua involve significant environmental challenges,
primarily related to the disposition of tailings, which are the crushed and ground rock material resulting from the
physical separation of commercially valuable minerals from the ore. We have comprehensive, ongoing
environmental management and monitoring plans for the disposal of tailings resulting from our milling operations,
which the Government of Indonesia has approved. Pursuant to these plans, we manage and monitor the impact of
our tailings disposal on the surrounding area of the Ajkwa River and adjoining water bodies and the surrounding
coastal areas. In 1997, we completed an engineered levee system to minimize the impact of the tailings through a
controlled deposition area located on a portion of the flood plain on the Ajkwa River.

In furtherance of our commitments to the Indonesian government pursuant to our tailings management
plan, we monitor the acid-neutralizing capacity of tailings on a daily basis to ensure the discharge of non-acid
generating tailings into our tailings deposition area. The net acid-neutralizing capacity of our tailings discharge is
maintained through a managed program of blending underground ore with ore from the open pit, the addition of
supplemental limestone (or lime) to the ore blend, and the addition of lime for control of the pH levels in the
flotation system. Daily samples are collected and tested and this data is communicated to our mill operations so that
adjustments in ore blending and lime/limestone addition can be made as appropriate.

With respect to overburden, control and treatment of acid rock drainage is our primary environmental issue.
Our approaches to this issue include the prevention of acid rock drainage generation, the control of acid rock
drainage migration, and the capture and treatment of acid rock drainage emanating from the overburden stockpile.
In addition, tests have shown the feasibility of revegetating the overburden stockpile and, as a result, we have
engaged in stockpile reclamation as an additional means of mitigating acid rock drainage.

We have made significant capital expenditures with respect to the capture and treatment of acid rock
drainage and additional capital expenditures are currently in progress. We continue to evaluate various technologies
for the treatment of captured acid rock drainage. Currently, acid rock drainage collected by boreholes at the base of
the overburden stockpile is treated using conventional lime neutralization.

We have also committed to the Indonesian government to have independent external environmental audits
of our Papuan operations performed by qualified experts every three years, with results available for public review.
We have had three independent environmental audits conducted by internationally recognized consulting and
auditing firms. SGS International Certification Services Indonesia, a member of the Société Générale de
Surveillance Group, completed the 2002 environmental audit. The 2002 audit found the overall approach to
practical management of environmental issues at PT Freeport Indonesia to be very sound. There were no audit
findings requiring corrective action. We also are continuing our annual internal audits, through the life of our
mining operations, so that our environmental management and monitoring programs will remain sound and our
operations will remain in material compliance with local laws.

In connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the Indonesian government, we committed
to performing a one-time environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan. We
completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four
years and submitted it to the Indonesian government in December 2002. We developed the risk assessment exercise
with input from an independent review panel, which included representatives from the Indonesian government,
academia, and non-governmental organizations. The risks that we identified during this process were in line with
our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents.

We have environmental approvals from the Government of Indonesia to expand our milling rate up to a
maximum of 300,000 metric tons of ore per day. In 2004, we averaged 185,100 metric tons of ore per day and in
2003 we averaged 203,000 metric tons of ore per day.

The cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental cost of our business. We incurred
aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs totaling $65.1 million in 2004, $72.1
million in 2003 and $62.6 million in 2002, including tailings management levee maintenance and mine reclamation.
In 2005, we expect to incur approximately $21 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and $39
million of other environmental costs. These environmental expenditures are part of our overall 2005 operating
budget.

24
We are currently revegetating portions of the tailings deposition area. Upon the completion of our mining
operations, we will fulfill the remaining commitments we made to the Indonesian government in connection with
our tailings management plan. Our options for revegetation of affected areas of the deposition area include natural
revegetation, forage crops and grasses, fruits, grains and vegetables, and other traditional food and medicinal crops.
Decisions on these options are made in consultation with local and regional government, local residents and other
stakeholders. In addition to the revegetation and reclamation of the deposition area, we will continue to operate
treatment systems as long as necessary. We also monitor and test the water discharged from our mine and the pH,
sulfate and electrical conductivity levels of ground water in the deposition area. The stability of our levees will be
ensured through routine visual inspection, revegetation of the levee embankments, and the transfer of our levee
roads for public use. Moreover, we will submit an annual written report to the Indonesian government regarding our
reclamation activities.

Our ultimate reclamation and closure activities will be determined after consultation with the Indonesian
government, local residents and other parties. Our best estimate is that PT Freeport Indonesia’s total aggregate
reclamation and closure obligations totaled approximately $149 million as of December 31, 2004. Estimates of
reclamation and closure costs involve complex issues requiring integrated assessments over a period of many years,
and we may revise them as we perform more complete studies. Some reclamation costs will be incurred during
mining activities, while most closure costs and the remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining
activities, which are currently estimated to continue for more than 35 years.

Moreover, we cannot predict with any certainty the ultimate future uses of the tailings deposition area once
our mining operations are completed. In addition to forage crop and grass planting and food and medicinal crop
production, possible future uses of the tailings deposition area include rainforest regrowth, production of timber, fuel
woods, fruits and nuts and other economic forestry, and the cultivation of fish, shellfish and other aquaculture. The
ultimate future uses will be determined in consultation with local and regional government, local residents and other
stakeholders.

In 1996, we began contributing to a cash fund ($6.0 million balance at December 31, 2004) designed to
accumulate at least $100 million by the end of our Indonesian mining activities. We plan to use this fund, including
accrued interest, to pay for mine closure and reclamation costs. Any incremental costs in excess of this $100 million
fund are expected to be incurred throughout the life of the mine and would be funded by operational cash flow or
other sources. An increasing emphasis on environmental issues and future changes in regulations could require us to
incur additional costs that would be charged against future operations. Estimates involving environmental matters
are by their nature imprecise and changes in government regulations, operations, technology and inflation could
require us to revise them over time.

We believe that Atlantic Copper’s facilities and operations are in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable Spanish environmental laws, rules and regulations. However, in July 2002, the Integrated Pollution
Prevention and Control guidelines were adopted under Spanish law with a phase in for compliance by 2007.
Atlantic Copper, working with local environmental authorities, is continually assessing the impact of these new
guidelines on its operations, and has budgeted approximately $30 million as its best estimate of the remaining
required capital expenditures from 2005 through 2007 to comply. In 2002, the Environmental Management Systems
at Atlantic Copper’s operations in Huelva, Cordoba and Barcelona were audited by the Spanish Association for
Standardization and Certification (AENOR), in accordance with the ISO 14001:96 international certification
standard and the new European Union Environmental, Eco-Management and Eco-Auditing (EMAS) Regulation No.
761/2001. AENOR is a Spanish not-for-profit entity that has been accredited by the Spanish government to inspect,
audit and certify environmental management systems. Atlantic Copper received positive results from the audits,
which are required annually to retain the ISO 14001 certification that Atlantic Copper achieved in prior years.

The Indonesian and Spanish governments may periodically revise their environmental laws and regulations
or adopt new ones, and we cannot predict the effects on our operations of new or revised regulations. We have
expended significant resources, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental regulations and
permitting and approval requirements, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. There can be
no assurance that we will not incur additional significant costs and liabilities to comply with such current and future
regulations or that such regulations will not materially affect our operations. See “Risk Factors.”

25
Wanagon Overburden Stockpile Slippage

In May 2000, a slippage occurred in the overburden stockpile at the Wanagon basin following a period of
excessive rainfall, causing a wave of water and material to overflow from the basin. Four employees of a contractor
to PT Freeport Indonesia were working in the area and perished. Contained within the mud were the treatment
solids from the lime precipitation of acid rock drainage, which then entered the tailings river system near the village
of Banti. We incurred environmental costs for overburden disposition, overburden stockpile stabilization, laboratory
testing and consulting studies relating to the Wanagon overburden waste stockpile. PT Freeport Indonesia charged
$2.9 million to its 2000 production costs, primarily for assets lost as a result of the incident.

Sampling and monitoring were renewed and expanded at a number of stations covering the entire tailings
system between the mine and estuary. A specific environmental risk analysis was conducted as a result of this event
and used data from the monitoring program. No long-term environmental effects were found from the direct
monitoring nor predicted by the environmental risk assessment. The slippage caused a flow of sediments containing
elevated levels of precipitated copper. As a result, water quality in the river was temporarily diminished due to
higher levels of total suspended solids. According to water quality tests, the pre-slippage water quality in the river
was substantially reestablished by the following day and was fully reestablished within 22 days after the incident.

PT Freeport Indonesia engaged international experts and outside consultants led by a team from the
Institute of Technology of Bandung (Indonesia) to conduct a comprehensive study of the cause of the slippage and
to recommend a future course of action. Working with the close cooperation of the Indonesian Department of
Energy and Natural Resources and also BAPEDAL (the Indonesian environmental protection agency), we initiated
an overburden stockpile stabilization program and voluntarily agreed to a temporary limitation on average
production from the Grasberg open pit of 200,000 metric tons per day. Underground ore production was not
affected. A safe-zone based on engineering calculations was subsequently identified along the Wanagon River and
within the village of Banti. The residents within this zone were temporarily moved to Tembagapura, our original
mining town site, and the houses were removed. These families were relocated to new housing designed according
to their wishes and located on higher ground in Banti.

After successful completion of the stabilization program and consultation with affected local residents, and
with the approval of the Indonesian government, normal overburden placement at the Wanagon overburden
stockpile resumed and the restriction on production from the Grasberg open pit was lifted at the end of 2000.

Employees and Relationship with FM Services Company

As of December 31, 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia had 7,858 employees (approximately 98 percent
Indonesian) and 6,247 contract workers, the vast majority of whom were Indonesian. Approximately 75 percent of
PT Freeport Indonesia’s employees are represented by the All Indonesia Workers’ Union, which operates under
Government of Indonesia supervision. PT Freeport Indonesia has a labor agreement covering all of its hourly-paid
Indonesian employees, the key provisions of which are renegotiated biannually. In June 2003, PT Freeport
Indonesia and its workers agreed to terms for a new labor agreement that expires September 30, 2005. PT Freeport
Indonesia’s relations with the workers’ union have generally been satisfactory. In addition, 4,587 persons worked
for privatized companies providing services within PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations area.

As of December 31, 2004, Atlantic Copper had 731 employees, of which approximately 75 percent are
represented by union contracts. In July 2003, Atlantic Copper successfully negotiated new labor contracts covering
its smelter/refinery and copper wire manufacturing workforce in Huelva, Spain with no material changes in terms.
Atlantic Copper’s union contracts in Huelva expired on December 31, 2004, and negotiations for new contracts are
expected to begin in April 2005. Atlantic Copper experienced a four-day labor strike in October 2004 at its smelter
facility in Huelva because of a workforce reduction plan. The union’s issues with the workforce reduction plan were
resolved and the plan was approved by Spanish authorities and implemented in December 2004.

FM Services Company (FM Services) furnishes executive, administrative, financial, accounting, legal, tax
and similar services to us. FM Services became our wholly owned subsidiary in October 2002, when we purchased
the remaining 50 percent ownership in FM Services from McMoRan Exploration Co. (McMoRan) for $1.3 million.
As of December 31, 2004, FCX had 11 employees and FM Services had 141 employees. FM Services employees
continue to provide services to McMoRan, a publicly traded company engaged in the exploration, development and
production of oil and gas, and Stratus Properties Inc., a publicly traded company engaged in the development of real
estate.

26
Nusamba Loan Guarantee

In 1997, PT Nusamba Mineral Industri (Nusamba), an Indonesian company and a subsidiary of PT
Nusantara Ampera Bakti, acquired from a third party approximately 51 percent of the capital stock of PT
Indocopper Investama. PT Indocopper Investama is an Indonesian company whose only significant assets are its
approximate 9.36 percent ownership of PT Freeport Indonesia’s common stock and its 10.0 percent ownership of
Eastern Minerals’ stock. Nusamba paid $61.6 million in cash and financed $253.4 million of the $315.0 million
purchase price with a variable-rate commercial loan from a syndicate of commercial banks, including JPMorgan
Chase Bank as agent, which was to mature in March 2002. We guaranteed the Nusamba loan for the purpose of
continuing minority Indonesian ownership of PT Freeport Indonesia. We also agreed to lend to Nusamba any
amounts to cover any shortfalls between the interest payments due on the commercial loan and dividends received
by Nusamba from PT Indocopper Investama. Through December 31, 2001, we loaned Nusamba $68.9 million to
cover such shortfalls and we charged $7.3 million of this amount to expense because the loans exceeded Nusamba’s
initial cash investment.

In early 2002, Nusamba informed us that it did not expect to be able to repay the bank loan or our loan at
maturity. On February 27, 2002, we repaid the bank loan as provided for under the terms of our credit facilities and
acquired Nusamba’s ownership in PT Indocopper Investama. For accounting purposes, the transactions were
deemed effective as of December 31, 2001. As a result of our payment of the Nusamba bank loan, our ownership
interest in PT Freeport Indonesia increased to 90.64 percent from 85.87 percent and our ownership interest in
Eastern Minerals increased to 100 percent from 95 percent.

Risk Factors

This report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-
looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as statements regarding
anticipated production volumes, sales volumes, ore grades, commodity prices, development and capital
expenditures, mine production and development plans, environmental reclamation and closure cost and plans,
reserve estimates, political, economic and social conditions in our areas of operations, and exploration efforts and
results. Except for our ongoing obligations under the federal securities laws, we do not intend, and we undertake no
obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those projected,
anticipated or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to
differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following:

Because our primary operating assets are located in the Republic of Indonesia, our business may be adversely
affected by Indonesian political, economic and social uncertainties, in addition to the usual risks associated
with conducting business in a foreign country.

Indonesia has faced political, economic and social uncertainties, including separatist movements and civil
and religious strife in a number of provinces. In particular, several separatist groups are opposing Indonesian rule
over the province of Papua, where our mining operations are located, and have sought political independence for the
province. In response to demands for political independence, new Indonesian regional autonomy laws became
effective January 1, 2001. However, the manner in which the new laws are being implemented and the degree of
political and economic autonomy that they may bring to individual provinces, including Papua, is uncertain and is a
current issue in Indonesian politics. Moreover, in Papua there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists
and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesian military. Social, economic and
political instability in Papua could materially and adversely affect us if this instability results in damage to our
property or interruption of our activities.

Maintaining a good working relationship with the Indonesian government is important to us because all of
our mining operations are located in Indonesia and are conducted pursuant to Contracts of Work with the Indonesian
government. Accordingly, we are also subject to the usual risks associated with conducting business in and with a
foreign country, including the risk of forced modification of existing contracts, changes in the country’s laws and
policies, including those relating to taxation, royalties, divestment, imports, exports and currency, and the risk of
having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of a
foreign court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory. In addition, we are subject to
the risk of expropriation, and our insurance does not cover losses caused by expropriation.

27
In addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, we face additional risks because our
operations are located on difficult terrain in a very remote area.

Our mining operations are located in steeply mountainous terrain in a very remote area in Indonesia.
Because of these conditions, we have had to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive
infrastructure facilities. In addition, the area receives considerable rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and
mudslides. The mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. In
addition to these special risks, we are also subject to the usual risks associated with the mining industry, such as the
risk of encountering unexpected geological conditions that may result in cave-ins and flooding of mine areas. Our
insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster.

On October 9, 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a section of the Grasberg open pit, resulting in eight
fatalities. On December 12, 2003, a debris flow involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the
same section of the open pit resulting in only minor property damage. All material involved in the affected mining
areas has been removed. The events caused us to alter our short-term mine sequencing plans, which adversely
affected our 2003 and 2004 production. While we resumed normal production activities in the second quarter of
2004, no assurance can be given that these events will not adversely affect production over the longer term or that
similar events will not occur in the future.

The terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, recent attacks in Indonesia and the
potential for additional future terrorist acts and other recent events have created economic and political
uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business and the prices of our securities.

On August 31, 2002, three people were killed and 11 others were wounded in an ambush by a group of
unidentified assailants. The assailants shot at several vehicles transporting international contract teachers from our
school in Tembagapura, their family members, and other contractors to PT Freeport Indonesia on the road near
Tembagapura, the mining town where the majority of PT Freeport Indonesia’s personnel reside. We, along with the
United States government, the central Indonesian government, the Papuan provincial and local governments, and
leaders of the local people residing in the area of our operations condemned the attack. Indonesian authorities and
the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the incident, which resulted in the U.S. indictment of
an alleged operational commander of the Free Papua Movement/National Freedom Force.

On October 12, 2002, a bombing killed 202 people in the Indonesian province of Bali, which is 1,500 miles
west of our mining and milling operations. Indonesian authorities arrested 35 people in connection with this
bombing and 29 of those arrested have been tried and convicted. On August 5, 2003, 12 people were killed and over
100 others were injured by a car bomb detonated outside of the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. On
September 9, 2004, 11 people were killed and over 200 others injured by a car bomb detonated in front of the
Australian embassy in Jakarta. The same international terrorist organizations are suspected in each of these
incidents. Our mining and milling operations were not interrupted by these incidents but our corporate office in
Jakarta had to relocate for several months following the bombing in front of the Australian embassy.

We cannot predict whether there will be additional incidents similar to the recent shooting or bombings. If
there were to be additional separatist, terrorist or other violence in Indonesia, it could materially and adversely affect
our business and profitability in ways that we cannot predict at this time.

Terrorist attacks and other recent events have caused uncertainty in the world’s financial and insurance
markets and may significantly increase global political, economic and social instability, including in Indonesia. In
addition to the Bali, JW Marriott Hotel and Australian embassy bombings, there have been anti-American
demonstrations in certain sections of Indonesia reportedly led by radical Islamic activists. Radical activists have also
threatened to attack foreign interests and have called for the expulsion of United States and British citizens and
companies from Indonesia.

It is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the United States domestically or abroad,
and such acts could be directed against properties and personnel of companies such as ours. The attacks and the
resulting economic and political uncertainties, including the potential for further terrorist acts, have caused our
insurance premiums to increase. Moreover, while our property and business interruption insurance covers damages
to insured property directly caused by terrorism, this insurance does not cover damages and losses caused by war.
Terrorism and war developments may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability and the prices of
our securities in ways that we cannot predict at this time.

28
Our profitability can vary significantly with fluctuations in the market prices of copper and gold.

Our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of copper concentrates, which also contain significant
quantities of gold and silver, and from the sale of copper cathodes and anodes. Although we sell most of our copper
concentrates under long-term contracts, the selling price is based on world metal prices at or near the time of
shipment and delivery.

During 2004, the daily closing prices on the London spot market ranged from $1.06 to $1.49 per pound for
copper and $374 to $456 per ounce for gold. During 2003, the daily closing prices on the London spot market
ranged from $0.70 to $1.05 per pound for copper and $320 to $417 per ounce for gold.

World copper prices have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our
control, including:

e the strength of the United States economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing
nations, including China;

e available supplies of copper from mine production and inventories;
e sales by holders and producers of copper;

e demand for industrial products containing copper; and

e — speculation.

World gold prices also have historically fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our
control, including:

e the strength of the United States economy and the economies of other industrialized and developing
nations, including China;

e — global or regional political or economic crises;

e the relative strength of the United States dollar and other currencies;

* expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;

e interest rates;

e — sales of gold by central banks and other holders;

e demand for jewelry containing gold; and

e — speculation.

Any material decrease in market prices of copper or gold would materially and adversely affect our results
of operations and financial condition. See our 2004 Annual Report incorporated herein by reference for an analysis

of the effect on our revenues and net income of changes in copper and gold prices.

Our Contracts of Work are subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and
if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel.

PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contracts of Work and other Contracts of Work in which we have an interest were
entered into under Indonesia’s 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which provides guarantees of remittance
rights and protection against nationalization. Our Contracts of Work can be terminated by the Government of
Indonesia if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations, which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the
government and the satisfaction of certain mining, environmental, safety and health requirements. Indonesian
government officials have periodically raised questions regarding our compliance with Indonesian environmental

29
laws and regulations and the terms of the Contracts of Work. In order to address these questions, the Indonesian
government formed a fact-finding team in 2000 that reviewed our compliance with all aspects of PT Freeport
Indonesia’s Contract of Work. When or whether the Indonesian government will release any report on its
investigation is uncertain. In addition, we cannot assure you that the Indonesian government’s report, if and when it
is released, will conclude that we are complying with all of the provisions of PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of
Work.

Moreover, in recent years, certain government officials and others in Indonesia have questioned the validity
of contracts entered into by the Government of Indonesia prior to October 1999 (i.e., during the Suharto regime),
including PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work, which was signed in December 1991. We cannot assure you
that the validity of, or our compliance with the Contracts of Work will not be challenged for political or other
reasons. PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contracts of Work and our other Contracts of Work require that disputes with the
Indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration. Notwithstanding that provision, if a dispute arises
under the Contracts of Work, we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration
panel, and if we prevail in such a dispute, we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of a
foreign court or arbitration panel against Indonesia within its own territory.

Any suspension of required activities under our Contracts of Work requires the consent of the Indonesian
government.

Our Contracts of Work permit us to suspend certain contractually required activities, including exploration,
for a period of one year by making a written request to the Indonesian government. These requests are subject to the
approval of the Indonesian government and are renewable annually. If we do not request a suspension or are denied
a suspension, then we are required to continue our activities under the Contract of Work or potentially be declared in
default. Moreover, if a suspension continues for more than one year for reasons other than force majeure and the
Indonesian government has not approved such continuation, then the government would be entitled to declare a
default under the Contract of Work.

We suspended our field exploration activities outside of Block A in recent years due to safety and security
issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration rights in certain
forest areas and an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in forest preservation areas.
In 2001, we requested and received from the Government of Indonesia, formal temporary suspensions of our
obligations under the Contracts of Work in all areas outside of Block A. Recent Indonesian legislation permits
open-pit mining in PT Freeport Indonesia’s Block B area, subject to certain requirements. We are currently assessing
these requirements and security issues. The timing for the resumption of exploration activities in our Contract of
Work areas outside of Block A depends on the resolution of these matters.

Our mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in
environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from our operations, could require us to incur
increased costs.

Mining operations on the scale of our operations in Papua involve significant environmental risks and
challenges. Our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called
tailings, that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and silver-bearing materials
from the ore that we mine. Our tailings management plan uses the river system near our mine to transport the
tailings to the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are deposited in a controlled area contained within a
levee system that will be revegetated. We incurred aggregate costs relating to tailings management of $11.8 million
in 2004, $8.3 million in 2003 and $7.0 million in 2002.

Another major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that must be moved
aside in the mining process in order to reach the ore. In the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria,
some overburden can cause acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals which, if not properly
managed, can have a negative impact on the environment.

Certain Indonesian governmental officials have from time to time raised issues with respect to our tailings and
overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than our river
deposition system for tailings disposal. Because our mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain
and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would be costly, difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to
catastrophic failure. An external panel of qualified experts, as directed in our 300K ANDAL (the Environmental Impact

30
Assessment document submitted to the Indonesian government), conducted detailed reviews and analyses of a number of
technical studies. They concluded that all significant impacts identified were in line with the 300K ANDAL predictions,
and that the current system of riverine tailings management was appropriate considering all site-specific factors. For
these reasons, we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical.

We anticipate that we will continue to spend significant financial and managerial resources on
environmental compliance. In addition, changes in Indonesian environmental laws or unanticipated environmental
impacts from our operations could require us to incur significant unanticipated costs.

The volume and grade of the reserves we recover and our rates of production may be more or less than we
anticipate.

Our reserve amounts are determined in accordance with established mining industry practices and
standards, but are merely estimates of the mineral deposits that can be recovered economically and legally. In
addition, our ore bodies may not conform to standard geological expectations. Because ore bodies do not contain
uniform grades of minerals, our metal recovery rates will vary from time to time, which will result in variations in
the volumes of minerals that we can sell from period to period. Some of our reserves may become unprofitable to
develop if there are unfavorable long-term market price fluctuations in copper and gold, or if there are significant
increases in our operating or capital costs. In addition, our exploration programs may not result in the discovery of
additional mineral deposits that we can mine profitably.

We do not expect to mine all of our reserves before the initial term of our Contract of Work expires.

All of our current proven and probable reserves, including the Grasberg deposit, are located in Block A.
The initial term of our Contract of Work covering these reserves expires at the end of 2021. We can extend this term
for two successive 10-year periods, subject to the approval of the Indonesian government, which under our Contract
of Work cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Our reserves reflect estimates of minerals that can be
recovered through the end of 2041 (i.e., through the expiration of the two 10-year extensions) and our current mine
plan has been developed, and our operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10-year
extensions. As a result, we will not mine all of our reserves during the current term of our Contract of Work, and
there can be no assurance that the Indonesian government will approve the extensions. Prior to the end of 2021, we
expect to mine approximately 47 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at December 31, 2004,
representing approximately 55 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of recoverable copper reserves and
approximately 69 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves.

Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash
depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our maturing debt depends on our ability to generate
sufficient cash flow. This ability, to a significant extent, is subject to commodity prices and general economic,
financial, regulatory, political and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds
in the future to service our debt will depend on meeting the financial covenants in our 10’%% senior notes due 2010,
our 67% senior notes due 2014, our bank credit facilities and other debt agreements we may have in the future.
Future borrowings may not be available to us under our bank credit facilities or from the capital markets in amounts
sufficient to enable us to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund other liquidity needs. As a result, we may
need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or
refinance our debt on favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.

Covenants in our bank credit facilities impose restrictions on us.

Although we currently have no amounts outstanding under our bank credit facilities, our bank credit
facilities:

e restrict the repurchase of, and payment of dividends on, our common stock under certain
circumstances;

e limit, among other things, our ability to:

e incur additional indebtedness;
31
e make investments;
e engage in transactions with affiliates;
e create liens on our assets; and
¢ require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests.

Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to
satisfy these covenants, which could result in a default. If an event of default occurs, the banks could declare any
amounts outstanding together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. An event of default under
our bank credit facilities may also give rise to an event of default under our other existing and future debt
agreements.

Covenants in our 10% senior notes due 2010 and 6”%% senior notes due 2014 also impose restrictions on us.
Our 10'%% senior notes and our 67% senior notes limit, among other things, our ability to:
e pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase and redeem certain classes of our capital stock;
e incur additional indebtedness;
e make investments;
e engage in transactions with affiliates; and
¢ create liens on our assets.
Movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could negatively affect our operating results.

All of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, some
costs, and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in Indonesian rupiah, Australian dollars or euros. As a
result, we are generally less profitable when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies.

The rupiah/U.S. dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged from 8,316 to 9,479 rupiah per U.S. dollar during
2004, and on December 31, 2004, the closing exchange rate was 9,270 rupiah per U.S. dollar compared with 8,437
rupiah per U.S. dollar on December 31, 2003. During 2004, the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar daily closing exchange
rate ranged from $0.68 to $0.80 per Australian dollar and the euro/U.S. dollar daily closing exchange rate ranged
from $1.18 to $1.37 per euro. On December 31, 2004 and 2003, the closing exchange rates were $0.78 per
Australian dollar and $1.36 per euro and $0.75 per Australian dollar and $1.26 per euro, respectively.

From time to time, we have in the past and may in the future implement currency hedges intended to reduce
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, our hedging strategies may not be successful,
and any of our unhedged foreign exchange payment requirements will continue to be subject to market fluctuations.
In addition, our bank credit facilities are based on fluctuating interest rates. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates
could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Because we are a holding company, our ability to pay our debts depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries
to pay us dividends and to advance us funds. In addition, our ability to participate in any distribution of our
subsidiaries’ assets is generally subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors.

Because we conduct business primarily through PT Freeport Indonesia, our major subsidiary, and other
subsidiaries, our ability to pay our debts depends upon the earnings and cash flow of PT Freeport Indonesia and our
other subsidiaries and their ability to pay us dividends and to advance us funds. Contractual and legal restrictions
applicable to our subsidiaries could also limit our ability to obtain cash from them. Our rights to participate in any
distribution of our subsidiaries’ assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be
subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors, including any trade creditors and preferred shareholders.

32
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

We are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings of a character normally incident to the
ordinary course of our business. We believe that potential liability in such proceedings would not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We maintain liability insurance to cover some, but
not all, potential liabilities normally incident to the ordinary course of our business as well as other insurance
coverage customary in our business, with coverage limits that we deem prudent.

PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities.

Reclassification of Class A and Class B Common Shares

On May 2, 2002, FCX’s stockholders approved a proposal to reclassify its Class A and Class B common
stock into a single class of common stock on a one share-for-one share basis. The reclassification simplified the
company’s capital structure, enhanced the company’s ability to structure and execute equity-based transactions,
increased the trading liquidity of the company’s common stock, and generated administrative cost savings.

Class B Common Shares

Our Class B common shares trade on the NYSE under the symbol “FCX.” The FCX share price is reported
daily in the financial press under “FMCG” in most listings of NYSE securities. At year-end 2004, the number of
holders of record of our Class B common shares was 8,999. NYSE composite tape Class B common share price
ranges during 2004 and 2003 follow:

2004 2003
High Low High Low
First Quarter $ 44.90 $ 35.09 $ 19.30 $ 16.01
Second Quarter 39.85 27.76 25.70 16.72
Third Quarter 42.13 31.54 34.57 23.45
Fourth Quarter 42.55 33.98 46.74 32.73

As of March 1, 2005, there were approximately 8,874 holders of record of our Class B common stock.
Common Share Dividends

In February 2003, the Board of Directors authorized a new cash dividend policy for FCX’s common stock
with the initial $0.09 per share quarterly dividend being paid on May 1, 2003. In October 2003, the Board of
Directors authorized an increase in the cash dividend to an annual rate of $0.80 per share and increased the dividend
again in October 2004 to an annual rate of $1.00 per share. In December 2004, the Board authorized a supplemental
common stock dividend of $0.25 per share, and in February 2005 the Board authorized a supplemental dividend of
$0.50 per share payable March 31, 2005 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2005. Below is a summary of the
common stock cash dividends declared and paid for the quarterly periods of 2004 and 2003, and the 2004
supplemental dividend:

2004 2003

The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our financial
results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. In addition, payment of
dividends on our common stock and purchases of common stock are subject to limitations under our 10’*% Senior
Notes and 67% Senior Notes and, in certain circumstances, our credit facility.

34
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

In October 2003, our Board of Directors approved a new open market share purchase program for up to 20
million shares, which replaced our previous program. The program does not have an expiration date. No shares
were purchased during the three-month period ended December 31, 2004, and 16.6 million shares remain available
for purchase.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

The information set forth under the caption “Selected Financial and Operating Data” of our 2004 Annual
Report is incorporated herein by reference.

Our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was as follows for the years presented.

Years Ended December 31,
2004 2003 2002 2001 2000
Ratio of earnings to fixed charges 4.7x 3.9x 3.4x 2.9x 2.3x
Ratio of earnings to fixed charges
and preferred stock dividends 2.8x 3.0x 2.5xX 2.1x 1.7x

For the ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculation, earnings consist of pre-tax income from continuing
operations before minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, income or loss from equity investees and fixed
charges. Fixed charges include interest and that portion of rent deemed representative of interest. For the ratio of
earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends calculation, we assumed that our preferred stock dividend
requirements were equal to the pre-tax earnings that would be required to cover those dividend requirements. We
computed those pre-tax earnings using actual tax rates for each year.

Items 7. and 7A. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks.

in our 2004 Annual Report, are incorporated herein by reference.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
Not applicable.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
with the participation of management, have evaluated the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures”
(as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on their evaluation, they have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to FCX (including our
consolidated subsidiaries) required to be disclosed in our periodic Commission filings.

(b) Changes in internal controls. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the fourth quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our
internal control over financial reporting.

(c) Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting and the report thereon of Ernst &
Young LLP are incorporated herein by reference to our 2004 Annual Report.

FREEPORT-McMoRan COPPER & GOLD INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OVERVIEW

In management's discussion and analysis, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) and
its consolidated subsidiaries. References to “aggregate” amounts mean the total of our share and Rio Tinto plc’s share as
our joint venture partner. The results of operations reported and summarized below are not necessarily indicative of future
operating results. The following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the
related notes.

We have one of the world’s largest copper and gold mining and production operations in terms of
reserves and production. We are also one of the lowest-cost copper producers in the world, after taking into
account credits for related gold and silver production. Our principal asset is the Grasberg minerals district,
which contains the largest single gold reserve and the second-largest copper reserves of any mine in the world.

We operate through our majority-owned subsidiaries, PT Freeport Indonesia and PT Puncakjaya
Power (Puncakjaya Power), and through Atlantic Copper, S.A. (Atlantic Copper) and PT Irja Eastern Minerals
(Eastern Minerals), our principal wholly owned subsidiaries. We acquired an 85.7 percent ownership in
Puncakjaya Power in 2003. Puncakjaya Power's sole business is to supply power to PT Freeport Indonesia’s
operations (see Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”). Atlantic Copper’s operations are in
Spain and involve the smelting and refining of copper concentrates and the marketing of refined copper
products and precious metals in slimes. PT Freeport Indonesia owns a 25 percent interest in PT Smelting, an
Indonesian company which operates a copper smelter and refinery in Gresik, Indonesia. Eastern Minerals
conducts mineral exploration activities (which are currently suspended) in Papua, Indonesia.

PT Freeport Indonesia, our principal operating subsidiary, operates under an agreement, called a
Contract of Work, with the Government of Indonesia. The Contract of Work allows us to conduct exploration,
mining and production activities in a 24,700-acre area called Block A located in Papua, Indonesia. Under the
Contract of Work, PT Freeport Indonesia also conducts exploration activities (which are currently suspended,
but are under review for resumption) in an approximate 500,000-acre area called Block B in Papua. All of our
proven and probable mineral reserves and current mining operations are located in Block A. Eastern Minerals
holds an additional Contract of Work originally covering a 2.5-million-acre area. Under the terms of Eastern
Minerals’ Contract of Work, we have already relinquished 1.3 million acres and must relinquish an additional
0.6 million acres at the end of the three-year exploration period, which can be extended by the Government of
Indonesia for as much as two additional years.

In addition to the PT Freeport Indonesia and Eastern Minerals exploration acreage, we have the right to
conduct other mineral exploration activities in Papua pursuant to a joint venture through PT Nabire Bakti
Mining. Field exploration activities outside of our current mining operations in Block A have been suspended in
recent years because of safety and security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict
between our mining and exploration rights in certain forest areas and an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in
1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in forest preservation areas. Recent Indonesian legislation permits open-pit
mining in PT Freeport Indonesia’s Block B area, subject to certain requirements. We are currently assessing
these requirements and security issues. The timing for our resumption of exploration activities in our Contract
of Work areas outside of Block A depends on the resolution of these matters.

We own 90.64 percent of PT Freeport Indonesia, of which 9.36 percent is owned through our wholly
owned subsidiary, PT Indocopper Investama. The Government of Indonesia owns the remaining 9.36 percent
of PT Freeport Indonesia. In July 2004, we received a request from the Indonesian Department of Energy and
Mineral Resources that we offer to sell to Indonesian nationals shares in PT Indocopper Investama at fair
market value. In response to this request and in view of the potential benefits of having additional Indonesian
ownership in our project, we have agreed to consider a potential sale of an interest in PT Indocopper
Investama at fair market value. Neither our Contract of Work nor Indonesian law requires us to divest any
portion of our ownership interest in PT Freeport Indonesia or PT Indocopper Investama.

Joint Ventures with Rio Tinto plc (Rio Tinto)

In 1996, we established joint ventures with Rio Tinto, an international mining company with headquarters in
London, England. One joint venture covers PT Freeport Indonesia’s mining operations in Block A and gives
Rio Tinto, through 2021, a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified
annual amounts of copper, gold and silver in Block A and, after 2021, a 40 percent interest in all production
from Block A. The agreement provides for adjustments to the specified annual metal sharing amounts upon
the occurrence of certain events that cause an extended interruption in production to occur, including events
such as the fourth-quarter 2003 Grasberg open-pit slippage and debris flow.

4
Operating, nonexpansion capital and administrative costs are shared proportionately between PT
Freeport Indonesia and Rio Tinto based on the ratio of (a) the incremental revenues from production from our
expansion completed in 1998 to (b) total revenues from production from Block A, including production from PT
Freeport Indonesia’s previously existing reserves. PT Freeport Indonesia receives 100 percent of the cash flow
from specified annual amounts of copper, gold and silver through 2021, calculated by reference to its proven
and probable reserves as of December 31, 1994, and 60 percent of all remaining cash flow. As noted above,
the specified annual amounts of copper, gold and silver attributable 100 percent to PT Freeport Indonesia are
adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events. As a result of the Grasberg slippage and debris flow events,
the 2004 specified amounts attributable 100 percent to PT Freeport Indonesia were reduced by 178 million
pounds for copper and 280,000 ounces for gold. Pursuant to an agreement with Rio Tinto, these reductions
are expected to be offset by increases in the specified amounts attributable 100 percent to PT Freeport
Indonesia totaling 111 million pounds for copper and 175,000 ounces for gold in 2005, and 67 million pounds
for copper and 105,000 ounces for gold in 2021.

Under our joint venture arrangements, Rio Tinto has a 40 percent interest in PT Freeport Indonesia’s
Contract of Work and in Eastern Minerals’ Contract of Work. Rio Tinto also has the option to participate in 40
percent of any of our other future exploration projects in Papua. Rio Tinto has elected to participate in 40
percent of our interest and cost in the PT Nabire Bakti exploration joint venture covering approximately 0.5
million acres contiguous to Block B and one of Eastern Minerals’ blocks.

Outlook

In 2004, our sales volumes of copper and gold totaled 1.0 billion pounds of copper and 1.44 million ounces
of gold. Our 2004 copper and gold sales volumes were lower than those reported for the last several years
because of recovery efforts from the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events at the Grasberg
open pit.

Following the October 9, 2003, slippage event and the December 12, 2003, debris flow in a section
of the Grasberg open pit, PT Freeport Indonesia accelerated the removal of overburden and mined low
grade ore prior to restoring safe access to higher-grade ore areas and resuming normal milling rates in
June 2004. Average ore grades improved in the second half of 2004 and are expected to be significantly
higher for 2005, compared with 2004. Annual sales are expected to approximate 1.5 billion pounds of
copper and 2.9 million ounces of gold in 2005, increases of 50 percent for copper and 100 percent for gold
compared with 2004. Assuming average copper prices of $1.35 per pound and average gold prices of
$420 per ounce, consolidated operating cash flows in 2005 are expected to exceed $1.1 billion. The
impact on our annual cash flow for each $0.10 per pound change in copper prices would approximate $75
million, including the effects of price changes on royalty costs and treatment charges, and for each $25 per
ounce change in gold prices would approximate $36 million.

Average annual sales volumes over the next five years (2005 to 2009) are expected to
approximate 1.36 billion pounds of copper and 2.2 million ounces of gold. Based on these estimates of
average annual sales volumes over the next five years and copper prices of approximately $1.35 per
pound and gold prices of approximately $420 per ounce, the impact on our annual cash flow for each $0.10
per pound change in copper prices would approximate $70 million, including the effects of price changes
on royalty costs and treatment charges, and for each $25 per ounce change in gold prices would
approximate $28 million.

The graph above presents London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices and reported stocks of copper
at the LME and New York Commodity Exchange (COMEX) through February 28, 2005. Copper markets have
reflected strong demand from China, which has become the world’s largest consumer of copper, stronger U.S.
industrial demand for copper and limited incremental supplies from mine production. Global demand for copper
exceeded global production during 2003 and 2004, resulting in a significant decline in available inventories, with
LME and COMEX inventories declining to levels of less than 100,000 metric tons, less than 10 percent of the
available stocks at the beginning of 2003. Copper prices rose sharply beginning in mid-2003 and continued to
increase in 2004, with prices ranging from $1.06 per pound to a multi-year high of $1.49 per pound in 2004.
Copper prices have remained strong in early 2005 and the LME spot price closed at $1.54 per pound on February
28, 2005. As a result of low inventory levels, expectations of continued strong demand and limited supplies, the
outlook for copper markets in 2005 is positive. Market analysts expect copper demand to exceed supply in the
first half of 2005, with a possibility of a balance between refined copper supply and demand in the second half of
the year. Future copper prices will be determined by demand from China, economic performance in the U.S. and
other industrialized countries, the timing of the development of new supplies of copper, production levels of mines
and copper smelters and other factors. We consider the underlying supply and demand conditions in the global
copper markets to be positive for our company.

The positive market environment and investor sentiment toward gold continued during 2004 with gold
prices ranging from $374 to $456 per ounce, supported by a weak U.S. dollar reflecting large U.S. deficits,
ongoing geopolitical strife and terrorism concerns, growing investment demand for gold and actions by gold
producers to reduce hedge positions. Gold prices averaged $410 per ounce in 2004. Recent movements in
gold prices have closely followed movements in the U.S. dollar against other currencies and most analysts
anticipate that a weak U.S. dollar will continue to support gold prices. The London gold price closed at
approximately $435 per ounce on February 28, 2005.

As shown in the graphs above, world metal prices for copper have fluctuated during the period from 1992
through February 2005 from a low of approximately $0.60 per pound in 2001 to a high of approximately $1.54 per
pound on February 28, 2005, and world gold prices have fluctuated during the period from 1998 through February
2005 from a low of approximately $250 per ounce in 1999 to a high of approximately $456 per ounce in 2004.
Copper and gold prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control as described further in our Form 10-
K for the year ended December 31, 2004.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of these statements requires that we make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base these
estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances;
however, reported results could differ from those based on the current estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. The areas requiring the use of management's estimates are discussed in Note 1 of “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” under the subheading “Use of Estimates.” Management has reviewed the
following discussion of its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee
of our Board of Directors.
Depreciation and Amortization — As discussed in Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,”
we depreciate our mining and milling assets using the unit-of-production method based on our estimates of
our proven and probable recoverable copper reserves. We have other assets that we depreciate on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Our estimates of proven and probable recoverable
copper reserves and of the useful lives of our straight-line assets impact our depreciation and amortization
expense. These estimates affect both our “mining and exploration” and “smelting and refining” segments.

Effective January 1, 2002, we changed our method of computing depreciation for PT Freeport
Indonesia’s mining and milling life-of-mine assets. See Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for a discussion of this change. The cumulative effect of this change through December 31,
2001, as reflected in our 2002 results, reduced net income by $3.0 million ($0.02 per share), net of taxes
and minority interest sharing.

The accounting estimates related to depreciation and amortization are critical accounting estimates
because (1) the determination of copper reserves involves uncertainties with respect to the ultimate
geology of our reserves and the assumptions used in determining the economic feasibility of mining those
reserves, including estimated copper and gold prices and costs of conducting future mining activities, and
(2) changes in estimated proven and probable recoverable copper reserves and useful asset lives can
have a material impact on net income. We perform annual assessments of our existing assets, including a
review of asset costs and depreciable lives, in connection with the review of mine operating and
development plans. When we determine that assigned asset lives do not reflect the expected remaining
period of benefit, we make prospective changes to those depreciable lives.

There are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves, including many
factors beyond our control. Ore reserves estimates are based upon engineering evaluations of samplings
of drill holes and other openings. Our estimates of proven and probable recoverable reserves are prepared
by our employees and reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining, geology and reserve
determination. As of December 31, 2004, aggregate proven and probable recoverable copper reserves
totaled 56.2 billion pounds and PT Freeport Indonesia’s estimated share totaled 40.5 billion pounds. These
estimates involve assumptions regarding future copper and gold prices, the geology of our mines, the
mining methods we use and the related costs we incur to develop and mine our reserves. Changes in
these assumptions could result in material adjustments to our reserve estimates, which could result in
changes to unit-of-production depreciation and amortization expense in future periods, with corresponding
adjustments to net income. If aggregate estimated copper reserves were 10 percent higher or lower at
December 31, 2004, we estimate that our annual depreciation expense for 2005 would change by
approximately $14 million, changing net income by approximately $7 million. Although some degree of
variability is expected, we believe the extent of our technical data and operating experience — specifically as
it relates to our Grasberg open-pit mine, which we have been mining for 15 years — mitigates the potential
for significant changes in reserve estimates, especially as compared with mines that are undeveloped or
newly developed.

As discussed in Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” we review and evaluate our
long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Changes to our estimates of proven and probable recoverable
copper and gold reserves could have an impact on our assessment of asset impairment. However, we
believe it is unlikely that revisions to our estimates of proven and probable recoverable copper and gold
reserves would give rise to an impairment of our assets because of the significant size of our reserves in
relation to our asset carrying values.

Deferred Mining Costs — Mining costs are charged to operations as incurred. However, because of
the configuration and location of the Grasberg ore body and the location and extent of surrounding
overburden, the ratio of overburden to ore is much higher in the initial mining of the pit than in later
years. As a result, surface mining costs associated with overburden removal at PT Freeport
Indonesia’s Grasberg open-pit mine that are estimated to relate to future production are initially
deferred when the ratio of actual overburden removed to ore mined exceeds the estimated
average ratio of overburden to ore over the life of the Grasberg open-pit mine. Those deferred
costs are subsequently charged to operating costs when the ratio of actual overburden removed to
ore mined falls below the estimated average ratio of overburden removed to ore mined over the life
of the Grasberg open-pit mine. We use the proven and probable ore reserves for the Grasberg
open pit disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements to calculate the estimated
average ratio of overburden to ore over the life of the mine.

The deferred mining cost method is used by some companies in the metals mining industry;
however, industry practice varies. The Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting

7
Standards Board (FASB) currently is evaluating this issue. The deferred mining cost method
matches the cost of production with the sale of the related metal from the open pit by assigning
each metric ton of ore removed an equivalent amount of overburden tonnage, thereby averaging
overburden removal costs over the life of the mine. The mining costs capitalized in inventory and
the amounts charged to cost of goods sold do not represent the actual costs incurred to mine the
ore in any given period. If we were to charge all mining costs to expense when incurred, including
all overburden removal costs, as some mining companies do, there would be greater volatility in
our period-to-period results of operations.

The application of the deferred mining cost method has resulted in an asset on our balance sheets
(“Deferred Mining Costs”), which based on current mine plans, is estimated to continue to increase through
about 2010. Subsequently, these costs are expected to begin to amortize as a charge to production and
delivery costs until they are fully amortized at the end of the open pit’s life, which is estimated to be in
approximately 2015. This is because PT Freeport Indonesia expects to mine higher than average amounts
of overburden through 2010 and less than average thereafter. Deferred mining costs totaled $220.4 million
at December 31, 2004, and $142.6 million at December 31, 2003. Additions to deferred mining costs are
classified as increases in deferred mining costs in operating activities in our consolidated statements of
cash flows and totaled $77.8 million in 2004, $64.4 million in 2003 and $30.6 million in 2002. We evaluate
the recoverability of our deferred mining costs in conjunction with our evaluation of the recoverability of our
mining assets. The Grasberg mine is currently our only producing open-pit mine.

The estimated average ratio of overburden to ore over the life of the Grasberg open pit used in our
deferred mining costs calculation is a critical accounting estimate because (1) it is susceptible to change
from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future mining activities
and (2) changes could materially affect net income. Our mine plan is derived from a model that takes into
consideration available geological data and determines the most efficient and cost-effective method of
accessing the economic reserves. Significant assumptions underlying our mine plan include the amount of
total overburden and ore we expect to move in a given year, the ultimate configuration of the pit and the
level of ore contributed by our underground mines. All other variables being equal, increases in the life of
mine overburden removed to ore mined ratio would result in more of the overburden removal costs being
matched with current period production and therefore charged to expense rather than deferred. Decreases
in the life of mine overburden removed to ore mined ratio would result in more of the overburden removal
costs being deferred and matched with production in future periods.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia changed its life-of-mine overburden-to-ore ratio to
2.4 to 1 based on a recently completed annual assessment. PT Freeport Indonesia’s estimated life-of-
mine overburden-to-ore ratio averaged 2.3 to 1 in 2004, 2.0 to 1 in 2003 and 1.8 to 1 in 2002. PT Freeport
Indonesia’s geologists and engineers reassess the overburden-to-ore ratio and the remaining life of the
Grasberg open-pit mine at least annually, and we reflect any changes in our estimates prospectively
beginning in the quarter of change. We expect the estimated life-of-mine overburden-to-ore ratio to
average 2.4 to 1 for 2005. The increases in the ratio over the last several years primarily relate to changes
in the cutoff grade at the open pit caused by a reassessment of the optimal milling rate at our mill facilities
including a greater proportional contribution to our total ore processed from our underground Deep Ore
Zone mine.

If the life-of-mine overburden-to-ore ratio was 2.4 to 1, as in the fourth quarter of 2004, instead of the
2.2 to 1 ratio used through September 30, 2004, we estimate our deferral of mining costs for 2004 would
have been $11.0 million lower and net income would have been $5.6 million ($0.03 per share) lower.

Reclamation and Closure Costs — Our mining operations involve activities that have a significant effect on
the surrounding area. Our reclamation and closure costs primarily involve treatment of acidic water (also
known as acid rock drainage) created by overburden, reclamation and revegetation of a large area in the
lowlands of Papua where mill tailings are deposited, reclamation of overburden stockpiles and
decommissioning of operating assets. Through December 31, 2002, we had accrued $29.2 million for
estimated closure and reclamation costs on a unit-of-production basis over our total estimated proven and
probable recoverable copper reserves. For a discussion of the assumptions that we make to estimate
proven and probable recoverable reserves, see “Depreciation and Amortization” above.

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (see Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements”). SFAS No. 143 requires that we record the fair value of our estimated asset retirement
obligations in the period incurred, with the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 as of January 1,
2003, for all existing asset retirement obligations, asset retirement costs and related accumulated
depreciation required to be reflected in earnings as a separate line item. The accounting estimates related

8
to reclamation and closure costs are critical accounting estimates because (1) we will not incur most of
these costs for a number of years, requiring us to make estimates over a long period; (2) reclamation and
closure laws and regulations could change in the future or circumstances affecting our operations could
change, either of which could result in significant changes to our current plans; (3) calculating the fair value
of our asset retirement obligations in accordance with SFAS No. 143 requires management to assign
probabilities to projected cash flows, to make long-term assumptions about inflation rates, to determine our
credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates and to determine market risk premiums that are appropriate for our
operations; and (4) given the magnitude of our estimated reclamation and closure costs, changes in any or
all of these estimates could have a material impact on net income.

In 2002, we engaged an independent environmental consulting and auditing firm to assist in estimating
PT Freeport Indonesia’s aggregate asset retirement obligations, and worked with other consultants in
estimating Atlantic Copper’s asset retirement obligations. We estimated these obligations using an
expected cash flow approach, in which multiple cash flow scenarios were used to reflect a range of
possible outcomes. We estimated these aggregate obligations to be approximately $120 million for PT
Freeport Indonesia and $17 million for Atlantic Copper. To calculate the fair value of these obligations, we
applied an estimated long-term inflation rate of 2.5 percent, except for Indonesian rupiah-denominated
labor costs with respect to PT Freeport Indonesia’s obligations, for which an estimated inflation rate of 9.0
percent was applied. The projected cash flows were discounted at our estimated credit-adjusted, risk-free
interest rates which ranged from 9.4 percent to 12.6 percent for the corresponding time periods over which
these costs would be incurred. The inflation rates and discount rates we used to calculate the fair value of
PT Freeport Indonesia’s asset retirement obligation are critical factors in the calculation of future value and
discounted present value costs. An increase of one percent in the inflation rates used results in an
approximate 17 percent increase in the discounted present value costs. A decrease of one percent in the
discount rates used has a similar effect resulting in an approximate 16 percent increase in the discounted
present value costs. After discounting the projected cash flows, a market risk premium of 10 percent was
applied to the total to reflect what a third party might require to assume these asset retirement obligations.
The market risk premium was based on market-based estimates of rates that a third party would have to
pay to insure its exposure to possible future increases in the value of these obligations.

At January 1, 2003, we estimated the fair value of our aggregate asset retirement obligations to be
$28.5 million. We recorded the fair value of these obligations and the related additional assets as of
January 1, 2003. The net difference between our previously recorded reclamation and closure cost liability
and the amounts estimated under SFAS No. 143, after taxes and minority interest, resulted in a gain of
$9.1 million (after reduction by $8.5 million for taxes and minority interest sharing), $0.06 per share ona
diluted basis, which was recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment for a change in accounting principle.
As a result of adopting SFAS No. 143, we expect our future depreciation and amortization expense to be
lower and our production costs to be higher, with no significant net impact on earnings for the near term.

The effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 was to increase net income by approximately $1 million, $0.01 per
share for 2003. Had we followed SFAS No. 143 during 2002, net income would have increased by
approximately $0.5 million or less than $0.01 per share.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, PT Freeport Indonesia revised its estimates for (1) changes in the
projected timing of certain reclamation costs because of the slippage and debris flow events in the Grasberg
open pit, (2) changes in certain cost estimates, and (3) additional asset retirement obligations incurred during
2003. We estimated PT Freeport Indonesia’s aggregate asset retirement obligations to be about $149 million
at December 31, 2004, and $130 million at December 31, 2003. An analysis of PT Freeport Indonesia’s
discounted asset retirement obligation follows (in millions):

2004 2003
Asset retirement obligation at beginning of year $ 25.7 $ 27.9
Accretion expense 2.8 2.7
Revisions for changes in estimates (6.5) (4.3)
Liabilities incurred - 0.6
Liabilities settled : (1.2)
Asset retirement obligation at end of year $ 22.0 $ 25.7

The expected deferral of certain costs was the primary change in estimates that caused the decline in the
obligation balance over the last two years. These changes reduced the related asset balance and are not
expected to have a material impact on future net income.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated revenues include PT Freeport Indonesia’s sale of copper concentrates, which also contain
significant quantities of gold and silver, and the sale by Atlantic Copper of copper anodes, cathodes, wire and
wire rod, and gold in anodes and slimes. Consolidated revenues and net income vary significantly with
fluctuations in the market prices of copper and gold and other factors. PT Freeport Indonesia’s intercompany
sales to Atlantic Copper are eliminated in consolidation. Consolidated revenues were $2.4 billion for 2004,
compared with $2.2 billion for 2003, reflecting significantly higher copper and gold prices partly offset by lower-
grade ore and reduced mill throughput as PT Freeport Indonesia accelerated the removal of overburden and
mined low-grade ore prior to restoring safe access to the higher-grade ore areas in its Grasberg open-pit mine
following the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events (see “Mining and Exploration Operations — PT
Freeport Indonesia Operating Results”). Atlantic Copper’s 2004 revenues were adversely affected by its
scheduled major maintenance turnaround (see “Smelting and Refining Operations — Atlantic Copper Operating
Results”) partly offset by higher copper and gold prices. Consolidated revenues in 2003 benefited from higher
copper and gold price realizations and higher gold sales volumes, partly offset by lower copper sales volumes
when compared with 2002 revenues of $1.9 billion.

Consolidated production and delivery costs were higher in 2004 at $1,450.3 million compared with
$1,071.3 million for 2003 and $938.5 million for 2002. The increase in 2004 was primarily because of higher
costs of concentrate purchases at Atlantic Copper caused by higher metals prices, higher production costs at
PT Freeport Indonesia and the costs of Atlantic Copper’s smelter turnaround. Production and delivery costs in
2003 were higher than in 2002 primarily because of higher concentrates costs at Atlantic Copper caused by the
increase in copper and gold prices during the year. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was
$206.4 million in 2004, $230.8 million in 2003 and $260.4 million in 2002. Depreciation and amortization
expense decreased each year during the last three years primarily because a large portion of our depreciation
is calculated on a unit-of-production basis and our copper sales volumes at PT Freeport Indonesia declined
each year.

Exploration expenses increased to $8.7 million in 2004, from $6.4 million in 2003 and $3.1 million in
2002, reflecting increased exploration drilling in Block A. Our 2004 drilling efforts resulted in additions to our
proven and probable reserves as of December 31, 2004 (see “Exploration and Reserves”). All approved
exploration costs in the joint venture areas with Rio Tinto are generally shared 60 percent by us and 40 percent
by Rio Tinto. The FCX/Rio Tinto joint ventures’ 2005 exploration budgets total approximately $21 million ($15
million for our share).

Consolidated general and administrative expenses increased to $89.9 million in 2004 from $80.3
million in 2003. General and administrative expenses for 2004 include a $2.2 million charge for Atlantic
Copper’s workforce reduction plan (see “Smelting and Refining Operations”). The cost of our outstanding
stock appreciation rights varies with the price of our common stock price, resulting in increases in general and
administrative expenses totaling $0.5 million in 2004 and $7.3 million in 2003. Our parent company charges
PT Freeport Indonesia for the in-the-money value of exercised employee stock options. These charges are
eliminated in consolidation; however, PT Freeport Indonesia shares these charges with Rio Tinto and Rio
Tinto’s reimbursements reduce our consolidated general and administrative expenses. General and
administrative expenses are net of Rio Tinto’s share of joint venture reimbursements for employee stock option
exercises, which reduced general and administrative expenses by $7.0 million in 2004 and $11.3 million in
2003. In addition, in accordance with our joint venture agreement, Rio Tinto’s percentage share of general and
administrative expenses in 2004 was lower because of lower metal sales volumes. Estimated general and
administrative expenses for 2005 are expected to approximate the 2004 level before consideration of the new
accounting rules for share-based payments discussed in “New Accounting Standards.”

General and administrative expenses increased by $12.0 million to $80.3 million in 2003 from $68.3
million in 2002. The increase relates to charges for costs associated with stock appreciation rights caused by
an increase in our stock price, higher compensation and other costs. As a percentage of revenues, general
and administrative expenses were 3.8 percent in 2004 and 3.6 percent in 2003 and 2002.

PT Freeport Indonesia maintains property damage and business interruption insurance related to its
operations. In December 2004, we entered into an insurance settlement agreement and settled all claims that
arose from the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events in the Grasberg open-pit mine. Our
insurers agreed to pay us an aggregate of $125.0 million, inclusive of interest and the $20.0 million paid to us in
the third quarter of 2004, in connection with our claims. After considering our joint venture partner’s interest in
the proceeds, PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of proceeds totaled $95.0 million. As a result of the settlement,
we recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income an $87.0 million gain on insurance settlement for the
business interruption recovery and an $8.0 million gain to production costs for the property loss recovery for a
net gain of $48.8 million ($0.26 per share), after taxes and minority interest sharing, in 2004.

10
Total consolidated interest cost (before capitalization) was $151.0 million in 2004, $200.0 million in
2003 and $183.4 million in 2002. Interest costs decreased in 2004 primarily because we reduced average debt
levels, including early conversions in 2003 and 2004 of all of the $603.8 million of our 84% Convertible Senior
Notes into 42.2 million shares of common stock (see Note 5 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”
and “Capital Resources and Liquidity — Financing Activities”). Interest cost increased in 2003 compared to
2002, primarily because of higher average interest rates for our senior notes issued in early 2003 and higher
average annual debt levels. Our interest cost for 2005 is expected to be about the same as 2004 unless we
elect to prepay certain long-term debt. Capitalized interest totaled $2.9 million in 2004, $3.0 million in 2003 and
$12.2 million in 2002. The reduction in capitalized interest in 2003 compared to 2002 reflects the completion of
initial development activities at the Deep Ore Zone underground mine in early 2003.

Losses on early extinguishment and conversion of debt in 2004 ($14.0 million) and 2003 ($34.6 million)
primarily resulted from the early conversions of our 8%4% Convertible Senior Notes. Gains on sales of assets
totaled $28.8 million in 2004 as a result of two transactions. In November 2004, a joint venture in which we
own a 50 percent interest completed the sale to a real estate developer of a parcel of land in Arizona where the
joint venture previously was engaged in a copper mining research project. Our share of the net proceeds from
the sale resulted in a gain of $21.3 million ($20.4 million to net income or $0.11 per share). In December 2004,
Atlantic Copper completed a sale of its wire rod and wire assets for $18.3 million cash and recorded a gain of
$7.5 million ($7.5 million to net income or $0.04 per share).

Other income (expense) includes the impact of translating into U.S. dollars Atlantic Copper’s net euro-
denominated liabilities, primarily its retiree pension obligations. Changes in the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate
require us to adjust the dollar value of our net euro-denominated liabilities and record the adjustment in
earnings. Exchange rate effects on our net income from euro-denominated liabilities were losses of $1.6
million in 2004, $13.6 million in 2003 and $11.9 million in 2002. The losses reflect a stronger euro in relation to
the U.S. dollar (see “Disclosures About Market Risks”). Other expenses in 2003 also include a $5.6 million
($3.7 million to net income or $0.02 per share) charge associated with the amended FCX and PT Freeport
Indonesia credit facility (see “Capital Resources and Liquidity — Financing Activities”) and interest income of
$5.9 million in 2004, $8.9 million in 2003 and $4.8 million in 2002.

PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work provides for a 35 percent corporate income tax rate. PT
Indocopper Investama pays a 30 percent corporate income tax on dividends it receives from its 9.36 percent
ownership in PT Freeport Indonesia. In addition, the tax treaty between Indonesia and the United States
provides for a withholding tax rate of 10 percent on dividends and interest that PT Freeport Indonesia and PT
Indocopper Investama pay to their parent company, FCX. We also incurred a U.S. alternative minimum tax at
a rate of two percent based primarily on consolidated income, net of smelting and refining results. As a result
of the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the 90 percent limitation on the use of foreign tax
credits to offset the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax liability has been repealed effective January 1, 2005.
Based on current projections, we expect that the removal of this limitation will significantly reduce our U.S.
federal taxes beginning in 2005. Our U.S. federal alternative minimum tax liability totaled $8.2 million in 2004,
$9.3 million in 2003 and $8.2 million in 2002. We currently record no income taxes at Atlantic Copper, which is
subject to taxation in Spain, because it has not generated significant taxable income in recent years and has
substantial tax loss carryforwards for which we have provided no financial statement benefit. We receive no
consolidated tax benefit from these losses because they cannot be used to offset PT Freeport Indonesia’s
profits in Indonesia.

Parent company costs consist primarily of interest, depreciation and amortization, and general and
administrative expenses. We receive minimal tax benefit from these costs, including interest expense,
primarily because our parent company generates no taxable income from U.S. sources. As a result, our
provision for income taxes as a percentage of our consolidated income before income taxes and minority
interests will vary as PT Freeport Indonesia’s income changes absent changes in Atlantic Copper and parent
company costs. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of consolidated income before income taxes
and minority interests totaled 58 percent for 2004 and 2003 and 55 percent for 2002. Summaries of the
approximate significant components of the calculation of our consolidated provision for income taxes are
shown below (in thousands, except percentages).

We have two operating segments: “mining and exploration” and “smelting and refining.” The mining
and exploration segment consists of our Indonesian activities including PT Freeport Indonesia’s copper and
gold mining operations, Puncakjaya Power's power generating operations (after eliminations with PT Freeport
Indonesia) and our Indonesian exploration activities, including those of Eastern Minerals. The smelting and
refining segment includes Atlantic Copper’s operations in Spain and PT Freeport Indonesia’s equity investment
in PT Smelting. Summary comparative operating income (loss) data by segment follow (in millions):

2003 and $(28.8) million in 2002. Our consolidated earnings fluctuate depending on the timing and prices
of these sales. At December 31, 2004, our deferred profits to be recognized in future periods’ operating
income totaled $80.9 million, $41.6 million to net income, after taxes and minority interest sharing.

Net cash production costs (credits) per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors
with information about the cash generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to
its primary metal product, copper. PT Freeport Indonesia uses this measure for the same purpose and for
monitoring operating performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of
performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies,
although our measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Fora
reconciliation of cash production costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported
in our consolidated financial statements, see “PT Freeport Indonesia Product Revenues and Net Cash
Production Costs” under “Product Revenues and Production Costs.”

PT Freeport Indonesia Operating Results — 2004 Compared with 2003

PT Freeport Indonesia’s 2004 revenues were slightly higher than 2003 revenues, with higher price realizations
offset by lower sales volumes. PT Freeport Indonesia reported lower production and sales in 2004, reflecting
the mining of lower-grade material and accelerated overburden removal activities following the fourth-quarter
2003 slippage and debris flow events. Copper sales volumes totaled 1.0 billion pounds in 2004, 23 percent
lower than the 1.3 billion pounds reported in 2003. Copper price realizations of $1.37 per pound in 2004 were
$0.55 per pound higher than the 2003 realizations of $0.82 per pound. Gold sales volumes totaled 1,443,000
ounces in 2004, 42 percent lower than the 2,469,800 ounces reported in 2003. Gold price realizations of
$412.32 per ounce in 2004 were $54.71 an ounce higher than the 2003 realizations of $357.61 per ounce,
before realized gains related to the redemption of our Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock. Gold realizations
were $366.60 per ounce in 2003 after hedging gains from redemption of our Gold-Denominated Preferred
Stock.

Treatment charges vary with the volume of metals sold and the price of copper, and royalties vary with
the volume of metals sold and the prices of copper and gold. In addition, treatment charges vary based on PT
Freeport Indonesia’s customer mix. Market rates for treatment and refining charges increased significantly
toward the end of 2004 and are expected to be higher in 2005; however, PT Freeport Indonesia expects its
2005 rates to approximate its 2004 rates because of its customer mix. Total treatment charges for PT Freeport
Indonesia in 2004 were lower because of the lower volume of metal sales. Royalty costs totaled $43.5 million
in 2004 compared with $26.5 million in 2003, reflecting higher metal prices partly offset by lower sales volumes.

13
Following the fourth-quarter 2003 Grasberg open-pit slippage and debris flow events, we accelerated
the removal of overburden and mined low-grade ore prior to restoring safe access to higher-grade ore areas in
the second quarter of 2004 and resuming normal milling rates in June 2004. Mill throughput averaged 185,100
metric tons of ore per day in 2004 and 203,000 metric tons of ore in 2003. Mill throughput, which varies
depending on ore types being processed, averaged 229,800 metric tons per day in the fourth quarter of 2004
and is expected to average approximately 235,000 metric tons per day in 2005. Approximate average daily
throughput processed at our mill facilities from each of our producing mines follows (metric tons of ore per
day):

Years Ended December 31,

2004 2003 2002
Grasberg open pit 141,500 155,700 194,500
Deep Ore Zone 43,600 40,500 21,800
Intermediate Ore Zone : 6,800 19,300
Total mill throughput 185,100 203,000 235,600

Production from the Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine averaged 43,600 metric tons of ore per
day, representing 24 percent of total 2004 mill throughput. DOZ operations continue to perform above design
capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day. PT Freeport Indonesia is expanding the capacity of the DOZ
underground operation to 50,000 metric tons per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional
ventilation. PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of capital expenditures for the DOZ expansion in the period 2004
through the projected 2007 ramp-up are expected to approximate $37 million, with $19 million estimated for
2005. The DOZ mine, a block cave operation, is one of the world’s largest underground operations. The
Intermediate Ore Zone underground mine was depleted during the third quarter of 2003, producing almost 30
percent more copper and gold throughout its 10-year life than the initial reserve estimates.

Copper ore grades averaged 0.87 percent in 2004, compared with 1.09 percent in 2003. Copper
recovery rates were 88.6 percent for 2004, compared with 89.0 percent for 2003. In 2004, gold ore grades
averaged 0.88 grams per metric ton (g/t), compared with 1.54 g/t in 2003. Gold recovery rates were 81.8
percent for 2004, compared with 87.3 percent for 2003. The mining of lower grade material resulted in lower
2004 recovery rates. Compared to 2004, ore grades are expected to be higher for 2005 resulting in increased
metal production in 2005. Gold recovery rates are expected to improve with the higher ore grades.

Unit net cash production costs, including gold and silver credits, averaged $0.40 per pound of copper
during 2004, compared with a net credit of $(0.02) per pound for 2003. Higher unit site production and delivery
costs in 2004 reflected significantly lower sales volumes resulting from lower ore grades and the primarily fixed
nature of a large portion of PT Freeport Indonesia’s cost structure. In addition, the lower sales volumes
resulted in PT Freeport Indonesia being allocated a larger percentage of those fixed costs in 2004 under our
joint venture arrangements with Rio Tinto. To a lesser extent, 2004 unit costs were impacted by higher energy
costs, increased maintenance costs, the impact of a stronger Australian dollar and increased treatment and
refining charge rates caused by higher copper prices and our customer mix.

Unit site production and delivery costs in 2004 averaged $0.77 per pound of copper, $0.29 per pound
higher than the $0.48 reported in 2003. Unit production and delivery costs are net of deferred mining costs of
$0.08 per pound ($77.8 million) for 2004 and $0.05 per pound ($64.4 million) for 2003. The increase in
deferred mining costs included the effects of PT Freeport Indonesia’s accelerated overburden removal efforts
during 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia changed its life-of-mine overburden-to-ore
ratio to 2.4 to 1 from 2.2 to 1, and in the fourth quarter of 2003 the ratio changed to 2.1 to 1 from 1.9 to 1, as
discussed above. The fourth-quarter 2004 change increased 2004 costs by $5.5 million or 0.6 cents per
pound. As of December 31, 2004, deferred mining costs totaled $220.4 million compared with $142.6 million at
December 31, 2003. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” for a discussion of changes in the estimated life-of-
mine overburden-to-ore ratio.

Gold and silver credits were $0.62 per pound for 2004, compared with $0.70 for 2003. The decrease
primarily reflects the reduced production and sales of gold during 2004, partly offset by the improved gold
realizations.

Unit treatment charges vary with the price of copper, and royalty rates vary with prices of copper and
gold. In addition, treatment charges vary based on PT Freeport Indonesia’s customer mix. Royalties of $0.04
per pound were $0.02 per pound above the year-ago period primarily because of higher copper and gold
prices. The copper royalty rate payable by PT Freeport Indonesia under its Contract of Work varies from 1.5
percent of copper net revenue at a copper price of $0.90 or less per pound to 3.5 percent at a copper price of
$1.10 or more per pound. The Contract of Work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 1.0 percent. In

14
connection with our fourth concentrator mill expansion completed in 1998, PT Freeport Indonesia agreed to pay
the Government of Indonesia additional royalties (royalties not required by the Contract of Work) to provide
further support to the local governments and the people of the Indonesian province of Papua. The additional
royalties are paid on metal from production from PT Freeport Indonesia’s milling facilities above 200,000 metric
tons of ore per day. The additional royalty for copper equals the Contract of Work royalty rate, and for gold and
silver equals twice the Contract of Work royalty rates. Therefore, PT Freeport Indonesia's royalty rate on
copper net revenues from production above 200,000 metric tons of ore per day is double the Contract of Work
royalty rate, and the royalty rates on gold and silver sales from production above 200,000 metric tons of ore per
day are triple the Contract of Work royalty rates. As a result of higher projected copper and gold sales volumes,
we expect our 2005 royalty costs to increase compared with 2004 royalty costs of $43.5 million. If copper
prices average $1.35 per pound and gold prices average $420 per ounce in 2005, we would expect royalty
costs to total approximately $90 million ($0.06 per pound) for 2005. These estimates assume 2005 sales
volumes of 1.5 billion pounds of copper and 2.9 million ounces of gold.

Assuming 2005 average prices of $1.35 per pound for copper and $420 per ounce for gold, and copper
and gold sales of 1.5 billion pounds and 2.9 million ounces for 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia estimates that its
gold credits would essentially offset its cash production costs, resulting in net cash production costs of
approximately zero cents per pound for the year 2005. Estimated unit cash costs reflect recent increases in
energy costs, a stronger Australian dollar currency and other factors. Net unit cash production costs for 2005
would change by approximately $0.05 per pound for each $25 per ounce change in the average price of gold.
Forecasted unit costs are calculated on the same basis as the historical unit costs, which are discussed above
and reconciled in “Product Revenues and Production Costs.”

As a result of the lower copper production and sales in 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia’s depreciation rate
per pound of copper increased to $0.17 for 2004 compared with $0.15 for 2003. For 2005, PT Freeport
Indonesia expects its deprecation rate to decrease to approximately $0.14 per pound, primarily because of
higher projected copper production and sales. Because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis,
the rate per pound will vary with the level of copper production and sales.

PT Freeport Indonesia Operating Results — 2003 Compared with 2002

PT Freeport Indonesia’s revenues increased by $225.6 million in 2003 from 2002. Both copper and gold price
realizations improved during 2003 with copper approximately 15 percent higher at $0.82 per pound and gold
approximately 18 percent higher at $366.60 per ounce. Gold revenues include a $22.1 million ($8.99 per
ounce) hedging gain from redemption of our Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock. Copper sales volumes
declined 15 percent to 1.3 billion pounds in 2003 from 1.5 billion pounds in 2002 because of lower copper ore
grades and reduced mill throughput resulting from the fourth-quarter slippage and debris flow events. Gold
sales volumes increased 8 percent to 2.5 million ounces in 2003 from 2.3 million ounces in 2002 because of
higher gold ore grades partly offset by lower mill throughput. Treatment charges were $46.6 million lower in
2003 compared with 2002 because of lower copper sales volumes and market treatment rates. Royalties were
higher at $26.5 million for 2003 compared with $24.5 million for 2002 primarily reflecting higher metals prices.

Mill throughput from production from PT Freeport Indonesia’s producing mines averaged 203,000
metric tons of ore per day in 2003 and 235,600 metric tons of ore per day in 2002. The lower mill throughput
rate during 2003 primarily reflects the impact of the fourth-quarter 2003 open-pit slippage and debris flow
events and the subsequent clean-up efforts. At the DOZ underground mine, production averaged 40,500
metric tons of ore per day for 2003, compared with 21,800 metric tons of ore per day for 2002. Production from
the Intermediate Ore Zone averaged 6,800 metric tons of ore per day for 2003 and 19,300 metric tons of ore
per day for 2002.

PT Freeport Indonesia reported record-low average unit net cash production costs of a net credit of
$(0.02) per pound in 2003, compared with $0.08 per pound in 2002. Unit site production and delivery costs in
2003 averaged $0.48 per pound of copper, $0.12 per pound higher than the $0.36 in 2002 primarily because of
lower copper sales volumes. Higher mine maintenance costs, stronger Indonesian and Australian currencies
and higher energy costs also resulted in higher costs compared with 2002.

Gold credits for 2003 of $0.70 per pound were higher than the gold credits of $0.48 per pound in
2002 primarily because of higher gold sales volumes and prices in 2003. Gold ore grades for 2003
improved by 24 percent to 1.54 grams per metric ton in 2003 from 1.24 grams per metric ton in 2002. Asa
result of the lower copper production and sales in 2003, PT Freeport Indonesia’s depreciation rate per
pound of copper increased to $0.15 for 2003 compared with $0.14 for 2002.
PT Freeport Indonesia Sales Outlook

PT Freeport Indonesia sells its copper concentrates primarily under long-term sales agreements denominated
in U.S. dollars, mostly to companies in Asia and Europe and to international trading companies. PT Freeport
Indonesia’s share of sales for 2005 is projected to approximate 1.5 billion pounds of copper and 2.9 million
ounces of gold, and to average 1.36 billion pounds of copper and 2.2 million ounces of gold annually over the
next five years (2005-2009). PT Freeport Indonesia expects its sales for the first quarter of 2005 to
approximate 310 million pounds of copper and 520,000 ounces of gold. Also, based on the current mine plan
for 2005, PT Freeport Indonesia estimates approximately 54 percent of its copper and 60 percent of its gold will
be produced in the second half of 2005. Because of the nature of the Grasberg ore body, the sequencing in
mining will cause ore grades to vary from quarter to quarter, particularly for gold.

PT Freeport Indonesia has long-term contracts to provide approximately 60 percent of Atlantic
Copper’s copper concentrate requirements at market prices and nearly all of PT Smelting’s copper concentrate
requirements. Under the PT Smelting contract, for the first 15 years of PT Smelting’s operations beginning
December 1998, the treatment and refining charges on the majority of the concentrate PT Freeport Indonesia
provides will not fall below specified minimum rates, subject to renegotiation in 2008. The rate was $0.23 per
pound during the period from the commencement of PT Smelting’s operations in 1998 until April 2004, when it
declined to a minimum of $0.21 per pound. Market rates, excluding price participation, under long-term
contracts settled in late 2004 approximate $0.21 per pound.

Exploration and Reserves

During 2004, net additions and revisions to the aggregate proven and probable reserves at the Grasberg
mining complex totaled approximately 141 million metric tons of ore representing increases of 2.9 billion
recoverable pounds of copper, 2.2 million recoverable ounces of gold and 18.9 million recoverable ounces of
silver. The additions were primarily the result of positive drilling results at the Deep Mill Level Zone ore body, a
146-million-metric-ton ore body. We expect to complete additional engineering studies evaluating drilling
results on the western side of the ore body in 2005, which could increase the size of the ore body. Our
aggregate exploration budget for 2005, including Rio Tinto’s share, is expected to total approximately $21
million ($15 million for our share) with most of the effort focused on testing the Mill Level Zone and Deep Mill
Level Zone deposits to the northwest, expansion of the underground Grasberg resource, and testing
reconnaissance targets along the Wanagon and Idenberg fault trends. Net of Rio Tinto’s share, PT Freeport
Indonesia’s share of proven and probable recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2004, was 40.5 billion
pounds of copper, 46.5 million ounces of gold and 124.5 million ounces of silver. FCX’s equity interest in
proven and probable recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2004, was 36.7 billion pounds of copper, 42.1
million ounces of gold and 112.8 million ounces of silver (see Note 13 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements”). PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of reserve additions replaced approximately 175 percent of its
2004 copper production, 90 percent of 2004 gold production and 330 percent of 2004 silver production.
Estimated recoverable reserves were assessed using a copper price of $0.85 per pound and a gold price of
$270 per ounce. If we adjusted metal prices used in our reserve estimates to the approximate average London
spot prices for the past three years ($0.94 per pound of copper and $361 per ounce of gold), the additions to
proven and probable reserves would not be material to reported reserves.

The Indonesian government previously approved suspensions of our field exploration activities outside
of our current mining operations area, which have been in suspension in recent years due to safety and
security issues and regulatory uncertainty relating to a possible conflict between our mining and exploration
rights in certain forest areas and an Indonesian Forestry law enacted in 1999 prohibiting open-pit mining in
forest preservation areas. The current suspensions were granted for one-year periods ending February 26,
2005, for Block B; March 31, 2005, for PT Nabire Bakti Mining; and November 15, 2004, for Eastern Minerals.
Recent Indonesian legislation permits open-pit mining in PT Freeport Indonesia’s Block B area, subject to
certain requirements. We are currently assessing these requirements and security issues. The timing for our
resumption of exploration activities in our Contract of Work areas outside of Block A depends on the resolution
of these matters.

SMELTING AND REFINING OPERATIONS

Our investment in smelters serves an important role in our concentrate marketing strategy. PT Freeport
Indonesia generally sells approximately one-half of its concentrate production to its affiliated smelters, Atlantic
Copper and PT Smelting, and the remainder to other customers. Treatment charges for smelting and refining
copper concentrates represent a cost to PT Freeport Indonesia and income to Atlantic Copper and PT
Smelting. Through downstream integration, we are assured placement of a significant portion of our
concentrate production. While low smelting and refining charges in recent years adversely affected the
operating results of Atlantic Copper, they benefited the operating results of PT Freeport Indonesia’s mining
operations, effectively achieving a hedge for these charges. Treatment and refining charge rates are currently

16
increasing. Higher future treatment and refining charges will benefit our smelter operations and adversely
affect our mining operations. Taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests, an equivalent change
in smelting and refining charge rates would essentially offset in our consolidated operating results.

Atlantic Copper Operating Results — 2004 Compared with 2003

Atlantic Copper completed a 51-day scheduled major maintenance turnaround in May 2004, adversely affecting
2004 results. Atlantic Copper’s operating cash margin was a $24.4 million deficit in 2004, compared with a
positive $22.4 million in 2003. The deficit in 2004 was primarily because of Atlantic Copper’s major
maintenance turnaround. Major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur approximately every
nine years for Atlantic Copper, with significantly shorter-term maintenance turnarounds occurring in the interim.

Atlantic Copper treated 768,100 metric tons of concentrate and scrap in 2004, compared with 964,400
metric tons in 2003. Cathode production totaled 454.7 million pounds and sales totaled 479.2 million pounds
during 2004, compared with cathode production of 544.7 million pounds and sales of 546.8 million pounds
during 2003. Atlantic Copper’s cathode cash production costs per pound of copper, before currency hedging,
averaged $0.25 in 2004 and $0.16 in 2003. Unit costs for 2004 were adversely affected by lower production
and higher costs from the maintenance turnaround. Treatment charges (including price participation), which
are what PT Freeport Indonesia and third parties pay Atlantic Copper to smelt and refine concentrates,
continued at historically low levels averaging $0.16 per pound for 2004 and 2003. Excess smelter capacity,
combined with limited copper concentrate availability, caused long-term treatment and refining rates to decline
since early 1998. However, treatment and refining rates increased in late 2004, and Atlantic Copper expects
these higher rates to benefit its operations starting in 2005.

Atlantic Copper reported operating losses of $83.5 million in 2004 and $21.8 million in 2003. The
higher losses in 2004 include a $12.0 million charge for workforce reductions, lower treatment charges and
lower production levels, compared with 2003. The effect of the 51-day turnaround on Atlantic Copper’s results
for 2004 was approximately $40 million, including an approximate $12 million impact from lower volumes.

During 2004, Atlantic Copper undertook a cost reduction and operational enhancement plan designed
to reduce unit costs, including a reduction in workforce, and enhance operational and administrative
efficiencies. The workforce reductions are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $8
million. In addition, in December 2004, Atlantic Copper completed a sale of its wire rod and wire assets for
$18.3 million cash, resulting in a $7.5 million gain. The sale will enable Atlantic Copper to simplify its business
and management structure and reduce working capital requirements. These actions, together with recently
negotiated higher treatment charges for 2005, are expected to improve operating results for Atlantic Copper in
2005 significantly.

In March 2004, we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our 6%% Senior Notes to repay
$162.4 million of Atlantic Copper borrowings (see “Capital Resources and Liquidity — Financing Activities”).
Atlantic Copper recorded a $3.7 million ($0.02 per share) accounting charge for losses on early extinguishment
of debt. As of December 31, 2004, FCX’s net investment in Atlantic Copper totaled $97.4 million, FCX had
$189.5 million of loans outstanding to Atlantic Copper and Atlantic Copper’s debt under financing arrangements
that are nonrecourse to FCX totaled $12.3 million.

17
We defer recognizing profits on PT Freeport Indonesia’s sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of
PT Freeport Indonesia’s sales to PT Smelting until the final sales to third parties occur. Changes in these net
deferrals resulted in a reduction to our operating income totaling $24.7 million ($12.7 million to net income or
$0.07 per share) in 2004, compared with an addition totaling $13.8 million ($7.1 million to net income or $0.04
per share) in 2003. At December 31, 2004, our net deferred profits on PT Freeport Indonesia concentrate
inventories at Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods’ net income after taxes and
minority interest sharing totaled $41.6 million.

The amount of profit we defer varies with the timing of concentrate shipments and metal prices. In
2003, we recognized previously deferred profit because of reduced shipments to Atlantic Copper and PT
Smelting caused by lower production from PT Freeport Indonesia’s open pit following the fourth-quarter
slippage and debris flow events. PT Freeport Indonesia resumed normal milling rates in June 2004 after
accelerating the removal of overburden and mining low-grade ore following the fourth-quarter 2003 events. As
a result of the return to normal milling rates, concentrate shipments to Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting
increased in the second half of 2004. These increased shipments and higher metal prices caused the net
deferrals and reduction in 2004 operating results. Based on current copper and gold prices and shipping
schedules, we expect that a deferral of profits on intercompany sales will result in a decrease to net income of
$22 million in the first quarter of 2005 as PT Freeport Indonesia’s shipments to affiliated smelters continue to
increase. The actual change in deferred intercompany profits may differ substantially because of changes in
the timing of shipments to affiliated smelters and metal prices.

Atlantic Copper Operating Results — 2003 Compared with 2002

Atlantic Copper’s cash margin of $22.4 million in 2003 was $21.0 million lower, compared with $43.4 million in
2002, primarily because of lower treatment charge rates and higher unit costs. Atlantic Copper’s cathode cash
production costs per pound of copper, before currency hedging, averaged $0.16 in 2003 and $0.12 in 2002.
The higher unit costs in 2003 primarily reflect a stronger euro in relation to the U.S. dollar, which added
approximately $0.03 per pound to the 2003 costs when compared to the 2002 costs. Atlantic Copper’s average
treatment rates were at historically low levels of $0.16 per pound for 2003 and $0.17 per pound for 2002.

Atlantic Copper recorded an operating loss of $21.8 million in 2003, compared with operating income of
$2.6 million in 2002. Atlantic Copper’s operating results also include a $9.6 million gain in 2003 and a $1.2
million charge in 2002 on currency hedging contracts maturing during the year. The effect of changes in the
deferred profits on PT Freeport Indonesia's sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT Freeport
Indonesia’s sales to PT Smelting resulted in additions to our operating income totaling $13.8 million ($7.1
million to net income or $0.04 per share) in 2003 and reductions totaling $28.8 million ($14.8 million to net
income or $0.10 per share) in 2002.

PT Smelting Operating Results — 2004 Compared with 2003

PT Freeport Indonesia accounts for its 25 percent interest in PT Smelting using the equity method and provides
PT Smelting with substantially all of its concentrate requirements (see Note 9 of “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements”). During the second quarter of 2004, PT Smelting completed a 31-day maintenance
turnaround and resumed normal operations. Major maintenance turnarounds of this duration typically occur
approximately every four years for PT Smelting, with significantly shorter-term maintenance turnarounds in the
interim. PT Smelting also completed a refinery expansion during the maintenance turnaround, increasing its
production capacity to approximately 250,000 metric tons of copper metal per year. PT Smelting treated
758,100 metric tons of concentrate in 2004 and 824,800 metric tons in 2003.

PT Smelting reported production of 464.0 million pounds of cathodes and sales of 462.9 million pounds
of cathodes in 2004, compared with production of 492.4 million pounds and sales of 493.5 million pounds in
2003. PT Smelting’s unit cathode cash production costs averaged $0.12 per pound in 2004 and $0.10 per
pound in 2003. The 2004 unit costs reflect the impact of lower volumes in 2004 resulting from the scheduled
maintenance turnaround.
PT Smelting Operating Results — 2003 Compared with 2002

PT Smelting treated 824,800 metric tons of concentrate in 2003, 15 percent more than the 719,600 metric tons
treated in 2002. PT Smelting’s copper cathode cash production costs per pound totaled $0.10 in 2003,
compared with $0.14 in 2002, reflecting the impact of the 28-day maintenance turnaround in May 2002.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Our operating cash flows vary with prices realized for copper and gold sales, our production levels,
production costs, cash payments for income taxes and interest, working capital changes and other factors.
Based on the current strong prices for copper and gold and our current mine plans, we expect to generate cash
flows significantly above our planned capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and other cash
requirements in 2005 and for the foreseeable future. We may use available cash to reduce debt in advance of
scheduled maturities, pay additional dividends (see discussion of supplemental dividends below) or purchase
shares of our common stock under our share purchase program, depending on our financial results, cash
requirements, future prospects and other factors.

Operating Activities

Our operating cash flows totaled $341.4 million in 2004, including $85.9 million received as a settlement from
insurance coverage related to the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events (see discussion above)
and $130.7 million in working capital requirements, compared with $572.1 million in 2003. The decrease in
2004 from the prior year reflects the extended maintenance turnaround at Atlantic Copper and increased
working capital requirements. For 2004, significant uses of cash from operating activities included increases in
deferred mining costs, accounts receivable and inventories. For 2003, significant uses included increases in
deferred mining costs and inventories, and payment of income taxes, partly offset by an increase in our
accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We have $195 million available under our revolving credit facility and
no amounts have been borrowed under this facility. At December 31, 2004, we had $551.5 million of cash and
cash equivalents.

Operating cash flows totaled $572.1 million in 2003, compared with $512.7 million in 2002. Working
capital, excluding cash, increased by $18.1 million in 2002 primarily because of increases in accounts
receivable and inventories, partly offset by an increase in accrued income taxes payable. Operating activities
are expected to generate positive cash flows for the foreseeable future based on anticipated operating results
and metal prices. Using current sales estimates and assuming metals prices of $1.35 per pound of copper and
$420 per ounce of gold, we expect our consolidated operating cash flows to exceed $1.1 billion in 2005. Each
$0.10 per pound change in copper prices would affect 2005 cash flows by approximately $75 million, including
the effects of price changes on royalty costs and treatment charges, and each $25 per ounce change in gold
prices would affect 2005 cash flows by approximately $36 million.

Investing Activities

Our total 2004 capital expenditures were $141.0 million compared to $139.2 million in 2003. The largest
individual capital expenditures for 2004 primarily related to long-term development projects, including
development of the DOZ mine, totaling approximately $37 million. Our 2003 capital expenditures included the
expansion of the DOZ mine (approximately $22 million) and work on the Grasberg overburden handling system
(approximately $21 million). Capital expenditures in 2002, which totaled $188.0 million, included costs at the
Grasberg open-pit operations totaling approximately $59 million for replacement capital such as new trucks,
shovels, and major development costs totaling approximately $69 million for the overburden handling system
and the DOZ mine.

Our capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to total approximately $180 million, including
approximately $19 million for the DOZ expansion and $17 million for other long-term development projects.
We expect to fund our 2005 capital expenditures with operating cash flows and available cash. Capital
expenditures are estimated to average approximately $145 million per year over the next five years.

In November 2004, a joint venture in which we own a 50 percent interest completed the sale to a real
estate developer of a parcel of land in Arizona where the joint venture previously was engaged in a copper
mining research project. Our share of net cash proceeds from the sale totaled $21.6 million. In December
2004, Atlantic Copper completed a sale of its wire rod and wire assets and received $18.3 million cash.

In 2001, we sold $603.8 million of 84% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006. The terms of the notes
required that we use $139.8 million of the proceeds to purchase a portfolio of U.S. government securities to
secure and pay for the first six semiannual interest payments. We sold $6.7 million of these restricted
investments in 2004, $46.6 million in 2003 and $47.9 million in 2002 to pay interest. Conversions of these
notes allowed us to sell $15.1 million of our restricted investments during 2004 and $27.0 million during 2003
(see below).

19
In July 2003, we acquired the 85.7 percent ownership interest in PT Puncakjaya Power owned by
affiliates of Duke Energy Corporation for $68.1 million cash, net of $9.9 million of cash acquired. PT Freeport
Indonesia purchases power from Puncakjaya Power under infrastructure asset financing arrangements.

Financing Activities

We completed several financing transactions over the last several years to improve our balance sheet and debt
maturity profile and enhance our financial flexibility. We are continuing to review opportunities to use a portion
of future operating cash flow to reduce debt in advance of scheduled maturities and to further improve our debt
maturity profile. In January 2004, we completed a tender offer and privately negotiated transactions for a
portion of our remaining 814% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006 resulting in the early conversion of $226.1
million of notes into 15.8 million shares of FCX common stock. We recorded a $10.9 million charge to losses
on early extinguishment and conversion of debt in connection with these conversions. The $10.9 million charge
included $6.4 million of previously accrued interest costs, resulting in an equivalent reduction in interest
expense. In June 2004, we called for redemption on July 31, 2004, all of the remaining $66.5 million of 814%
Convertible Senior Notes. During July, all remaining notes were converted into 4.7 million shares of FCX
common stock. As of July 31, 2004, all of the 84% Convertible Senior Notes, which totaled $603.8 million at
issuance in 2001, had been converted into 42.2 million shares of FCX common stock.

On February 3, 2004, we sold $350 million of 67% Senior Notes due 2014 for net proceeds of $344.4
million. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay $162.4 million of Atlantic Copper borrowings and to
refinance other FCX 2004 debt maturities. Atlantic Copper recorded a $3.7 million charge to losses on early
extinguishment of debt to accelerate amortization of deferred financing costs. Interest on the notes is payable
semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2004. We may redeem some or
all of the notes at our option at a make-whole redemption price prior to February 1, 2009, and afterwards at
stated redemption prices. The indenture governing the notes contains certain restrictions, including restrictions
on incurring debt, creating liens, selling assets, entering into transactions with affiliates, paying cash dividends
on common stock, repurchasing or redeeming common or preferred equity, prepaying subordinated debt and
making investments. During the second quarter of 2004, we purchased in the open market $9.7 million of the
6%% Senior Notes for $8.8 million, which resulted in a gain of $0.8 million recorded as a reduction to losses on
early extinguishment and conversion of debt, including related deferred financing cost.

On March 30, 2004, we sold 1.1 million shares of 512% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock for $1.1
billion, with net proceeds totaling $1.067 billion. Each share of preferred stock was initially convertible into
18.8019 shares of our common stock, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $53.19 per common
share. The conversion rate is adjustable upon the occurrence of certain events, including any quarter that our
common stock dividend exceeds $0.20 per share. As a result of the common stock dividends discussed below
and a quarterly dividend paid on February 1, 2005, each share of preferred stock is now convertible into
18.9794 shares of FCX common stock, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $52.69 per common
share. In February 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a supplemental dividend of $0.50 per share
payable on March 31, 2005, which will result in another adjustment to the conversion price in March 2005.
Beginning March 30, 2009, we may redeem shares of the preferred stock by paying cash, our common stock or
any combination thereof for $1,000 per share plus unpaid dividends, but only if our common stock price has
exceeded 130 percent of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the notice of redemption. We used a portion of the proceeds from the sale
to purchase 23.9 million shares of FCX common stock owned by Rio Tinto for $881.9 million (approximately
$36.85 per share) and used the remainder for general corporate purposes. Rio Tinto no longer owns any
equity interest in FCX; however, it is still PT Freeport Indonesia’s joint venture partner.

As of December 31, 2004, we had total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $551.5 million and
total outstanding debt of $1.95 billion. In February 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the initiation of an
annual cash dividend on our common stock of $0.36 per share, increased the dividend in October 2003 to an
annual rate of $0.80 per share and increased the dividend again in October 2004 to an annual rate of $1.00 per
share. In December 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a supplemental common stock dividend of $0.25
per share, which was paid on December 29, 2004. Dividend payments on common stock totaled $198.8 million
in 2004 and $41.7 million in 2003. As discussed above, in February 2005 the Board authorized a supplemental
common stock dividend of $0.50 per share payable March 31, 2005. The declaration and payment of dividends
is at the discretion of our Board. The amount of our current quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and
the possible payment of additional future supplemental cash dividends will depend on our financial results, cash
requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. Pursuant to the restricted
payment covenants in our 10%% Senior Notes and 67%% Senior Notes, the amount available for dividend
payments and other restricted payments as of December 31, 2004, was approximately $510 million.

20
In August 2004, we funded the sixth of eight scheduled annual redemption payments on our Silver-
Denominated Preferred Stock for $13.9 million. The mandatory redemption resulted in a $12.5 million
decrease in debt and a hedging loss to revenues of $1.4 million ($0.7 million to net income or less than $0.01
per share) in 2004. Mandatory partial redemptions of our Silver-Denominated Preferred Stock totaled $10.8
million in 2003 and $11.7 million in 2002.

In 2003, the Board approved a new open market share purchase program for up to 20 million shares,
which replaced our previous program. Under this new program, we acquired 3.4 million shares during the
second quarter of 2004 for $99.5 million, $29.39 per share average, and 16.6 million shares remain available.
No shares were purchased during the second half of 2004 and through February 28, 2005. The timing of future
purchases of our common stock is dependent on many factors including the price of our common shares, our
cash flow and financial position, and general economic and market conditions.

During the first quarter of 2003, we completed two senior note offerings. On January 29, 2003, we sold
$500 million of 10%% Senior Notes due 2010. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually on February 1 and
August 1 of each year. We may redeem some or all of the notes at our option at a make-whole redemption
price prior to February 1, 2007, and afterwards at stated redemption prices. The indenture governing the notes
contains certain restrictions on incurring debt, creating liens, entering into sale leaseback transactions, taking
actions to limit distributions from certain subsidiaries, selling assets, entering into transactions with affiliates,
paying cash dividends on common stock, repurchasing or redeeming common or preferred equity, prepaying
subordinated debt and making investments.

In February 2003, we sold $575 million of 7% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011. Interest on the
notes is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The notes are convertible, at the
option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of FCX’s common stock at a conversion
price of $30.87 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 32.39 shares of common stock
per $1,000 principal amount of notes. We used a portion of the $1.046 billion in net proceeds from the two
first-quarter 2003 note offerings to repay all of the then-outstanding amounts under our bank credit facilities.

In April 2003, we concluded tender offers to purchase our outstanding 7.20% Senior Notes due 2026
and our 7.50% Senior Notes due 2006. Of the $450 million outstanding at March 31, 2003, notes with a face
amount of $234.0 million were tendered for $239.0 million cash. We recorded a charge of $6.6 million ($4.8
million to net income or $0.03 per share) in 2003 associated with these early extinguishments of debt. In July
2003, we purchased an additional $76.0 million face amount of our 7.20% Senior Notes for $77.2 million, and
recorded a $1.3 million ($0.9 million to net income or less than $0.01 per share) charge to losses on
extinguishment of debt. In October 2003, the holders of $68.9 million of the remaining $73.5 million of
outstanding 7.20% Senior Notes elected early repayment in November 2003. We currently have outstanding
$4.5 million of 7.20% Senior Notes and $66.5 million of 7.50% Senior Notes.

In August 2003, we redeemed 6.0 million shares of Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock for $210.5
million and partially redeemed our Silver-Denominated Preferred Stock for $10.8 million. The mandatory
redemptions resulted in a $245.1 million decrease in debt and a hedging gain to revenues of $23.8 million
($12.2 million to net income or $0.08 per share).

In August 20038, we privately negotiated the early conversion of 51.5 percent of our 8%4% Convertible
Senior Notes, which resulted in a $311.1 million reduction in debt. The holders converted their notes into 21.76
million shares of FCX common stock and received $23.0 million in cash from restricted investments held in
escrow for payment of future interest on these notes. We recorded charges totaling $24.7 million ($24.2 million
to net income or $0.15 per share) related to these conversions.

In October 2003, FCX and PT Freeport Indonesia entered into an amended revolving credit facility that
provides a commitment of $195 million and matures in September 2006. We recorded charges totaling $5.6
million ($3.7 million to net income or $0.02 per share) in 2003 to accelerate amortization of deferred financing
costs related to the prior credit facility.

In December 2003, we called for redemption the depositary shares representing our 7% Step-Up
Convertible Preferred Stock. Of the 14.0 million depositary shares outstanding at the time of the call, 13.8
million depositary shares were converted into 11.5 million shares of FCX common stock. The remaining
shares were redeemed for approximately $7 million cash.

As a result of the transactions discussed above, we had net cash borrowings (repayments) of debt,

including preferred stock redemptions, of $(31.2) million in 2004, $31.7 million in 2003 and $(333.3) million in
2002.

Represents additional amounts due above the original issue amounts based on the price of silver and gold,

respectively, totaling $3.7 million in 2005 and 2006 for our Silver-Denominated Preferred Stock and $21.2
million in February 2006 for our Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock, Series Il. We calculated these
amounts using the December 31, 2004, London A.M. gold fixing price for one ounce of gold ($438.00) and
the London silver fixing price for one ounce of silver ($6.82) in the London bullion market (which determine

the preferred stock redemption amounts).

Other Contractual Obligations

In addition to our debt and redeemable preferred stock maturities shown above, we have other contractual
obligations and commitments, which we expect to fund with projected operating cash flows, available credit
facilities or future financing transactions, if necessary. These obligations and commitments include PT
Freeport Indonesia’s commitments to provide one percent of its annual revenue for development of the local
people in our area of operations through the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development and to
contribute amounts to a cash fund designed to accumulate at least $100 million by the end of our Indonesian
mining activities to pay for mine closure and reclamation. Atlantic Copper has a mostly unfunded contractual
obligation denominated in euros to supplement amounts paid to retired employees. In August 2002, Atlantic
Copper complied with Spanish legislation by agreeing to fund 7.2 million euros annually for 15 years, beginning
August 2002, to an approved insurance company for an estimated 72 million euro contractual obligation to the
retired employees. Atlantic Copper had $69.8 million recorded as of December 31, 2004, for this obligation and
is amortizing the unaccrued balance of approximately $7.9 million over the remaining 12-year funding period.
Atlantic Copper has firm contractual commitments with third parties to purchase concentrates at market prices.
We have various noncancelable operating leases and open purchase orders at December 31, 2004. A
summary of these various obligations follows (in millions, except concentrates):

Environmental Matters

We believe that we conduct our Indonesian operations pursuant to applicable permits and that we comply in all
material respects with applicable Indonesian environmental laws, rules and regulations. We have had three
independent environmental audits conducted by internationally recognized environmental consulting and
auditing firms. Audits were completed in 1996 by Dames & Moore, in 1999 by Montgomery Watson, and in
2002 by SGS International Certification Services Indonesia, a member of the Société Générale de Surveillance
group. The 2002 audit found that the overall approach to practical management of environmental issues at PT
Freeport Indonesia is considered to be very sound. There were no audit findings requiring corrective action.

In connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the Indonesian government, we
committed to performing a one-time environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management
plan. We completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies
conducted over four years and submitted it to the Indonesian government in December 2002. We developed
the risk assessment study with input from an independent review panel, which included representatives from
the Indonesian government, academia and non-governmental organizations. The risks that we identified during
this process were in line with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our
environmental approval documents.

We will determine our ultimate reclamation and closure activities based on applicable laws and
regulations and our assessment of appropriate remedial activities in the circumstances after consultation with
governmental authorities, affected local residents and other affected parties. As of December 31, 2004, we
estimated aggregate reclamation and closure obligations to be approximately $149 million for PT Freeport
Indonesia and $18 million for Atlantic Copper. Estimates of the ultimate reclamation and closure costs we will
incur in the future involve complex issues requiring integrated assessments over a period of many years and
are subject to revision over time, and actual costs may vary from our estimates. Some reclamation costs will
be incurred during mining activities, while most closure costs and the remaining reclamation costs will be
incurred at the end of the Grasberg open-pit mining operations and at the end of all mining activities, which are
currently estimated to continue for more than 35 years.

In 1996, we began contributing to a cash fund ($6.0 million balance at December 31, 2004) designed to
accumulate at least $100 million by the end of our Indonesian mining activities. We plan to use this fund,
including accrued interest, to pay mine closure and reclamation costs. Any costs in excess of the $100 million
fund would be funded by operational cash flow or other sources. Future changes in regulations could require
us to incur additional costs which would be charged against future operations. Estimates involving
environmental matters are by their nature imprecise and can be expected to be revised over time because of
changes in government regulations, operations, technology and inflation.

The cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental cost of our business. We incurred
aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs totaling $65.1 million in 2004,
$72.1 million in 2003 and $62.6 million in 2002, including tailings management levee maintenance and mine
reclamation. In 2005, we expect to incur approximately $21 million of aggregate environmental capital
expenditures and $39 million of other environmental costs. These environmental expenditures are part of our
overall 2005 operating budget.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

Commodity Price Risk

Our consolidated revenues include PT Freeport Indonesia’s sale of copper concentrates, which also contain
significant quantities of gold and silver, and Atlantic Copper’s sale of copper anodes, cathodes, wire rod, wire
and precious metals in slimes. Atlantic Copper sold its wire rod and wire assets in December 2004. Our
consolidated revenues and net income vary significantly with fluctuations in the market prices of copper and
gold and other factors. A change of $0.10 in the average price per pound of copper would have an
approximate $150 million impact on our 2005 consolidated revenues and an approximate $75 million impact on
our 2005 consolidated net income, assuming approximately 1.5 billion pounds of 2005 PT Freeport Indonesia
copper sales. A change of $25 in the average price per ounce of gold would have an approximate $72 million
impact on our 2005 consolidated revenues and an approximate $36 million impact on our 2005 consolidated
net income, assuming approximately 2.9 million ounces of 2005 PT Freeport Indonesia gold sales.

At times, in response to market conditions, we have in the past and may in the future enter into copper
and gold price protection contracts for some portion of our expected future mine production to mitigate the risk
of adverse price fluctuations. We currently have no commodity price protection contracts relating to our mine
production other than our gold-denominated and silver-denominated preferred stock discussed below.

23
PT Freeport Indonesia’s concentrate sales agreements, with regard to copper, provide for provisional
billings at the time of shipment with final pricing settlement generally based on the average LME price for a
specified future period. Under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”
PT Freeport Indonesia’s sales based on a provisional sales price contain an embedded derivative, which we
bifurcate from the sale of the concentrates at the current spot LME price. The embedded derivative, which
does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked-to-market through earnings each period until the date of final
copper pricing (see Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”). At December 31, 2004, we had
consolidated embedded derivatives on copper sales totaling 292.2 million pounds recorded at an average price
of $1.45 per pound. We expect final prices on these sales over the next few months. We estimate that a two-
cent movement in the average price used for these embedded derivatives will have an approximate $3 million
impact on our 2005 consolidated net income.

We have outstanding two issues of redeemable preferred stock, which have cash dividend and
redemption requirements indexed to gold and silver prices. We account for these securities as a hedge of
future production and reflect them as debt on our balance sheets at their original issue value less redemptions.
As redemption payments occur, differences between the carrying value and the redemption payment, which is
based on commodity prices at the time of redemption, are recorded as an adjustment to revenues (see Notes
1,5 and 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”). During 2003, we redeemed all our gold-
denominated preferred stock due in August 2003 and made an annual partial redemption of our silver-
denominated stock. We paid $221.3 million to redeem these securities, which had a book balance of $245.1
million. We recorded the $23.8 million gain as revenues. In August 2004, we funded the sixth of eight
scheduled annual redemption payments on our Silver-Denominated Preferred Stock for $13.9 million. The
mandatory redemption resulted in a $12.5 million decrease in debt and a hedging loss to revenues of $1.4
million ($0.7 million to net income or less than $0.01 per share) in 2004. Future redemption payments
denominated in ounces and equivalent value in dollars, as well as dollar-equivalent dividend payments, based
on the December 31, 2004, London A.M. gold fixing price for one ounce of gold ($438.00) and the London
silver fixing price for one ounce of silver ($6.82) in the London bullion market (which determine the preferred
stock redemption and dividend amounts), follow (dollars in millions):

$ 188.6 167.4 $ 324 $ 25.0

The fair values of the redeemable preferred stock, based on December 31, 2004, quoted market prices
of $43.65 per depositary share for our gold-denominated preferred stock due in 2006 and $7.40 per depositary
share for our silver-denominated preferred stock, were $187.9 million for the preferred stock indexed to gold
prices and $35.2 million for the preferred stock indexed to silver prices.

Atlantic Copper prices its purchases of copper concentrate at approximately the same time as it sells
the refined copper, thereby protecting Atlantic Copper from most copper price risk. Atlantic Copper enters into
futures contracts to hedge its price risk whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing periods do not
match. At December 31, 2004, Atlantic Copper had contracts, with a fair value of $(0.9) million, to sell 12.7
million pounds of copper at an average price of $1.40 per pound through March 2005.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Our operations are in Indonesia and Spain, where our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. All of our
revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, some costs and
certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in Indonesian rupiah, Australian dollars or euros.
Generally, our costs are positively affected when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to those foreign
currencies and adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies.

One U.S. dollar was equivalent to 9,270 rupiah at December 31, 2004, 8,437 rupiah at December 31,
2003, and 8,940 rupiah at December 31, 2002. PT Freeport Indonesia recorded losses to production costs
totaling $0.7 million in 2004, $3.0 million in 2003 and $3.5 million in 2002 related to its rupiah-denominated net
monetary assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2004, net liabilities totaled $7.7 million at an exchange rate of
9,270 rupiah to one U.S. dollar.

Operationally, changes in the U.S. dollar to rupiah exchange rate primarily impact PT Freeport
Indonesia’s labor costs, which are mostly rupiah denominated. At estimated annual aggregate rupiah
payments of 1.4 trillion and an exchange rate of 9,270 rupiah to one U.S. dollar, the exchange rate as of

24
December 31, 2004, a one-thousand-rupiah increase in the exchange rate would result in an approximate $15
million decrease in aggregate annual operating costs. A one-thousand-rupiah decrease in the exchange rate
would result in an approximate $18 million increase in aggregate annual operating costs.

PT Freeport Indonesia purchases certain materials, supplies and services denominated in Australian
dollars. The exchange rate was $0.78 to one Australian dollar at December 31, 2004, $0.75 to one Australian
dollar at December 31, 2003, and $0.56 to one Australian dollar at December 31, 2002. At estimated annual
aggregate Australian dollar payments of 225 million and an exchange rate of $0.78 to one Australian dollar, the
exchange rate as of December 31, 2004, a $0.01 increase or decrease in the exchange rate would result in an
approximate $2 million change in aggregate annual operating costs.

At times, PT Freeport Indonesia has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion
of its aggregate anticipated Indonesian rupiah and Australian dollar payments. As of December 31, 2004, PT
Freeport Indonesia had foreign currency contracts to hedge 450.0 billion in rupiah payments from April 2005
through December 2005, or approximately 32 percent of aggregate projected rupiah payments for 2005, at an
average exchange rate of 10,059 rupiah to one U.S. dollar. PT Freeport Indonesia accounts for these
contracts as cash flow hedges. We recorded net gains to production costs totaling $11.0 million in 2002 for PT
Freeport Indonesia’s previous foreign currency contracts.

The majority of Atlantic Copper’s revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, operating costs
other than concentrate purchases and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in euros. Atlantic
Copper’s estimated annual euro payments total approximately 100 million euros. At a December 31, 2004,
exchange rate of $1.36 per euro, a $0.05 increase or decrease in the exchange rate would result in an
approximate $5 million change in annual costs.

In connection with refinancing its debt in June 2000, Atlantic Copper’s lenders required it to hedge its
anticipated euro-denominated operating costs. This hedging requirement was removed when Atlantic Copper
refinanced the facility in March 2004. Atlantic Copper had no outstanding currency hedging contracts at
December 31, 2004. Atlantic Copper’s operating results reflect gains (losses) on currency hedging contracts
totaling $9.6 million in 2003 and $(1.2) million in 2002.

Atlantic Copper had euro-denominated net monetary liabilities at December 31, 2004, totaling $74.0
million. The exchange rate was $1.36 per euro at December 31, 2004, $1.26 per euro at December 31, 2003,
and $1.05 per euro at December 31, 2002. Adjustments to Atlantic Copper’s euro-denominated net monetary
liabilities to reflect changes in the exchange rate are recorded in other income (expense) and totaled $(1.6)
million in 2004, $(13.6) million in 2003 and $(11.9) million in 2002.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In November 2004, FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4.” SFAS No. 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight handling costs and
wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges and requires the allocation of fixed
production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We must adopt
SFAS No. 151 no later than January 1, 2006. We have not yet determined when we will adopt SFAS No. 151;
however, we currently do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our accounting for inventory costs.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS
No. 123 (revised 2004) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Through December 31, 2004, we
have accounted for grants of employee stock options under the recognition principles of APB Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations, which require compensation costs for
stock-based employee compensation plans to be recognized based on the difference on the date of grant, if
any, between the quoted market price of the stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.

25
If we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” which requires compensation cost for all stock-based employee compensation plans to be
recognized based on the use of a fair value method, our net income would have been reduced by $5.2 million,
$0.05 per diluted share, for 2004, $4.7 million, $0.05 per diluted share, for 2003 and $6.5 million, $0.07 per
diluted share, for 2002 (see Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”). We must adopt SFAS
No. 123 (revised 2004) no later than July 1, 2005; however, we can elect to adopt SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004)
as early as January 1, 2005. We are still reviewing the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) and have
not yet determined if we will adopt SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) before July 1, 2005. Also, stock options were
granted to employees in February 2005, including multi-year grants to our senior executive officers. Asa
result, the annual charges for share-based payments will be higher than the pro forma annual amounts
presented in Note 1 of “Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements.” Based on currently outstanding
employee stock options, including those granted in February 2005, if we adopt SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) on
July 1, 2005, we estimate the charge to earnings before taxes and minority interest sharing in the second half
of 2005 would total approximately $11 million, and the reduction in net income would be approximately $6.5
million, $0.04 per basic share using common shares outstanding at December 31, 2004.

PRODUCT REVENUES AND PRODUCTION COSTS

PT Freeport Indonesia Product Revenues and Net Cash Production Costs

Net cash production costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information
about the cash generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to its primary metal
product, copper. PT Freeport Indonesia uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating
performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies, although our measures
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

We calculate gross profit per pound of copper under a “by-product” method, while the copper, gold and
silver contained within our concentrates are treated as co-products in our financial statements. We use the by-
product method in our presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (1) the majority of our
revenues are copper revenues, (2) we produce and sell one product, concentrates, which contains all three
metals and (3) it is not possible to specifically assign our costs to revenues from the copper, gold and silver we
produce in concentrates. In the co-product method presentation below, costs are allocated to the different
products based on their relative revenue values.

In both the by-product and the co-product method calculations below, we show adjustments to
revenues for prior period open sales and for hedging as separate line items. Because the copper pricing
adjustments do not result from current period sales, we have reflected these separately from revenues on
current period sales. Hedging adjustments, which are attributed to our commodity-indexed preferred stock, are
included with pricing adjustments because they result from transactions outside of our sales contracts.
Noncash and other nonrecurring costs, which consist of items such as write-offs of equipment or unusual
charges, have not been material. They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation
of net cash production costs (credits). As discussed above, gold and silver revenues are reflected as credits
against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. PT Freeport Indonesia’s gross profit totals
are before considering the impact of the elimination of its share of profits on its sales to PT Smelting.
Presentations under both methods are presented below together with a reconciliation to amounts reported in
our consolidated financial statements.

PT Smelting Cathode Cash Production Cost Per Pound of Copper

PT Smelting cathode cash production cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with
information about the costs it incurs to produce cathodes at its smelting operations in Indonesia. We use this
measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at PT Smelting’s smelting operations.
This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Other smelting companies present
this measure, although PT Smelting’s measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
other companies. The calculation below presents PT Smelting’s reported operating costs and subtracts or
adds those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. PT
Smelting’s operating costs are then reconciled to PT Freeport Indonesia’s equity in PT Smelting earnings
(losses) reported in FCX’s consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per pound amounts):

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
FREEPORT-McMoRan COPPER & GOLD INC.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.
and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income,
cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2003, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” and effective July 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, the Company changed
its method of computing depreciation for PT Freeport Indonesia’s mining and milling life-of-mine assets.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated March 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.’s (the Company’s) management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the
Company's Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

e Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets;

e Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and

e Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company's internal control system was designed to provide
reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and
fair presentation of its published financial statements.

Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this
annual report on Form 10-K. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on our management’s assessment, management believes that, as of December
31, 2004, our Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued their attestation report
on our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, as stated in their report dated March 9, 2005, which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OF FREEPORT-McMoRan COPPER & GOLD INC.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, that Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and its subsidiaries maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on
the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management's assessment that Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and its
subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.
and its subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and its
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of income, cash flows and
stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 and our report dated
March 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) include the accounts of those subsidiaries where FCX directly or indirectly has more than
50 percent of the voting rights and has the right to control significant management decisions. FCX
consolidates its 90.6 percent-owned subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia and its 85.7 percent-owned
subsidiary PT Puncakjaya Power (Puncakjaya Power), as well as its wholly owned subsidiaries,
primarily Atlantic Copper, S.A. and PT Irja Eastern Minerals. FCX’s unincorporated joint ventures
with Rio Tinto plc are reflected using the proportionate consolidation method (Note 2). PT Freeport
Indonesia’s 25 percent ownership interest and related investment in PT Smelting is accounted for
under the equity method (Note 9). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation. Changes in
the accounting principles applied during the years presented are discussed below under the captions
“Property, Plant, Equipment and Development Costs,” “Reclamation and Closure Costs” and
“Derivative Instruments.”

Use of Estimates. The preparation of FCX’s financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying
notes. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include mineral
reserve estimation, useful asset lives for depreciation and amortization, the estimated average ratio
of overburden removed to ore mined over the life of the open-pit mine, allowances for obsolete
inventory, reclamation and closure costs, environmental obligations, postretirement and other
employee benefits, deferred taxes and valuation allowances and future cash flows associated with
assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Investments. Highly liquid investments purchased with
maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. At December 31, 2003,
restricted investments included U.S. government securities, plus accrued interest thereon, totaling
$24.0 million, pledged as security for scheduled interest payments through July 31, 2004, on FCX’s
84% Convertible Senior Notes (see Note 5). Restricted cash held in escrow as security on Atlantic
Copper’s working capital revolver totaled $11.0 million at December 31, 2003 (see Note 5).

Other Accounts Receivable. Other accounts receivable include $30.5 million at December 31,
2004, related to the settlement of an insurance claim (see Note 10); a receivable from Rio Tinto
totaling $11.5 million at December 31, 2004, and $10.5 million at December 31, 2003, for its current
share of infrastructure financing arrangements with Puncakjaya Power (see Note 2); and value-
added taxes totaling $20.6 million at December 31, 2004, and $12.4 million at December 31, 2003.

Inventories. In-process inventories represent materials that are currently in the process of being
converted to a salable product. PT Freeport Indonesia does not have material quantities of in-
process inventories. For Atlantic Copper, in-process inventories represent copper concentrates at
various stages of conversion into anodes and cathodes. Atlantic Copper’s in-process inventories are
valued at the cost of the material fed to the smelting and refining process plus in-process conversion
cost. Inventories of materials and supplies, as well as salable products, are stated at the lower of
cost or market. PT Freeport Indonesia uses the average cost method for all inventories and Atlantic
Copper uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method for its sales of finished copper products (see
Note 3).

Property, Plant, Equipment and Development Costs. Property, plant, equipment and
development costs are carried at cost. Mineral exploration costs are expensed as incurred, except in
the year when proven and probable reserves have been established for a given property, in which
case all exploration costs for that property incurred since the beginning of that year are capitalized.
Refer to Note 13 for the definition of proven and probable reserves. No exploration costs were
capitalized during the years presented. Development costs are capitalized beginning after proven
and probable reserves have been established. Development costs include costs incurred resulting
from mine pre-production activities undertaken to gain access to proven and probable reserves
including adits, drifts, ramps, permanent excavations, infrastructure and removal of overburden.
Additionally, interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to
constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Expenditures for

At
replacements and improvements are capitalized. Costs related to periodic scheduled maintenance
(turnarounds) are expensed as incurred. Depreciation for mining and milling life-of-mine assets is
determined using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable proven and
probable copper reserves. Development costs that relate to a specific ore body are depreciated
using the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable proven and probable copper
reserves for the ore body benefited. Recording of depreciation and amortization using the unit-of-
production method occurs upon extraction of the recoverable copper from the ore body, at which time
it is allocated to inventory cost and then included as a component of cost of goods sold. Other assets
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of 15 to 20 years for buildings and
3 to 25 years for machinery and equipment.

Effective January 1, 2002, FCX changed its method of computing depreciation for PT
Freeport Indonesia’s mining and milling life-of-mine assets. Prior to January 1, 2002, PT Freeport
Indonesia depreciated mining and milling life-of-mine assets on a composite basis. Total historical
capitalized costs and estimated future development costs relating to its developed and undeveloped
reserves were depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on total developed and
undeveloped proven and probable copper reserves. Estimated future costs, which are significant, to
develop PT Freeport Indonesia’s undeveloped ore bodies are expected to be incurred over the next
20 to 25 years.

After considering the inherent uncertainties and subjectivity relating to the long time frame
over which these estimated costs would be incurred, management revised its depreciation
methodology prospectively. Effective January 1, 2002, depreciation for the mining and milling life-of-
mine assets excludes consideration of future development costs. Under the new methodology, PT
Freeport Indonesia depreciates the capitalized costs of individual producing mines over the related
proven and probable copper reserves. Infrastructure and other common costs continue to be
depreciated over total proven and probable copper reserves.

Asset Impairment. FCX reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss is measured as the amount by which asset carrying value exceeds its fair value.
Fair value is generally determined using valuation techniques such as estimated future cash flows.
An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are
less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on
discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows for PT Freeport Indonesia’s mining
assets, which are considered one asset group, include estimates of recoverable pounds and ounces,
metal prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production
rates and costs, capital and reclamation costs as appropriate, all based on detailed life-of-mine
engineering plans. Future cash flows for Atlantic Copper’s smelting assets include estimates of
treatment and refining rates (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related
factors), production rates and costs, capital and reclamation costs as appropriate, all based on
operating projections. Assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks and
uncertainties. No impairment losses were recorded during the periods presented.

Deferred Mining Costs. Mining costs are charged to operations as incurred. However, because of
the configuration and location of the Grasberg open-pit ore body and the location and extent of the
related surrounding overburden, the ratio of overburden to ore is much higher in the initial mining of
the open pit than in later years. As a result, surface mining costs associated with overburden
removal at PT Freeport Indonesia’s Grasberg open-pit mine that are estimated to relate to future
production are initially deferred when the ratio of actual overburden removed to ore mined exceeds
the estimated average ratio of overburden removed to ore mined over the life of the Grasberg open-
pit mine. Those deferred costs are subsequently charged to operating costs when the ratio of actual
overburden removed to ore mined falls below the estimated average ratio of overburden to ore over
the life of the Grasberg open-pit mine. The reserve quantities used to develop the life of mine ratio
are the proven and probable ore quantities for the Grasberg open pit disclosed in Note 13.

The deferred mining cost method is used by some companies in the metals mining industry;
however, industry practice varies. The Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) currently is evaluating this issue. The deferred mining cost method
matches the cost of production with the sale of the related metal from the open pit by assigning each
metric ton of ore removed an equivalent amount of overburden tonnage thereby averaging the
overburden removal costs over the life of the mine. The mining costs capitalized in inventory and the
amounts charged to cost of goods sold do not represent the actual costs incurred to mine the ore in

42
any given period. If PT Freeport Indonesia were to charge all mining costs to expense when
incurred, including all overburden removal costs, as some mining companies do, there would be
greater volatility in FCX’s period-to-period results of operations.

The application of the deferred mining cost method has resulted in an asset on FCX’s
balance sheets (“Deferred Mining Costs”), which based on current mine plans, is estimated to
increase through about 2010. Subsequently, these costs are expected to be amortized as a charge
to production and delivery costs until they are fully amortized at the end of the open pit’s life, which is
estimated to be in approximately 2015. This is because PT Freeport Indonesia expects to mine
higher than average amounts of overburden through 2010 and less than average thereafter.
Deferred mining costs totaled $220.4 million at December 31, 2004, and $142.6 million at December
31, 2003. Additions to deferred mining costs are classified as increases in deferred mining costs in
operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows and totaled $77.8 million in 2004,
$64.4 million in 2003 and $30.6 million in 2002. PT Freeport Indonesia evaluates the recoverability of
these deferred mining costs in conjunction with its evaluation of the recoverability of its mining assets
as described in FCX’s “Asset Impairment” accounting policy. The Grasberg mine is currently FCX’s
only producing open-pit mine.

PT Freeport Indonesia’s geologists and engineers reassess the overburden to ore ratio and
the remaining life of its open-pit mine at least annually, and any changes in estimates are reflected
prospectively beginning in the quarter of change. All other variables being equal, increases in the life
of mine overburden removed to ore mined ratio would result in more of the overburden removal costs
being matched with current period production and therefore charged to expense rather than deferred.

Decreases in the life of mine overburden removed to ore mined ratio would result in more of the
overburden removal costs being deferred and matched with production in future periods.

PT Freeport Indonesia’s estimated ratio of mine overburden removed to ore mined over the
life of the mine in its deferred mining costs calculation averaged 2.3 to 1 in 2004, 2.0 to 1 in 2003 and
1.8 to 1 in 2002. The ratio changed in the fourth quarter of each of the last three years and the
impact of the changes on each year’s results was to decrease net income by $2.8 million ($0.02 per
share) in 2004, $1.5 million ($0.01 per share) in 2003 and $1.1 million ($0.01 per share) in 2002. If
the changes in the ratio in the fourth quarter of 2004 (2.4 to 1) had been applied at the beginning of
the year, the deferral of mining costs for 2004 would have been an estimated $11.0 million lower and
net income would have been $5.6 million ($0.03 per share) lower. For 2005, the estimated average
ratio of overburden to ore over the life of the mine in PT Freeport Indonesia’s deferred mining
calculation is expected to be 2.4 to 1.

The increases in the ratio over the last several years primarily relate to changes in the cutoff
grade at the Grasberg open pit caused by a reassessment of the optimal milling rate at the mill
facilities, including a greater proportional contribution to total ore processed from the underground
Deep Ore Zone mine.

Reclamation and Closure Costs. Effective January 1, 2003, FCX adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which
requires recording the fair value of an asset retirement obligation associated with tangible long-lived
assets in the period incurred. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets included
within the scope of SFAS No. 143 are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under
existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction.

In 2002, FCX engaged an independent environmental consulting and auditing firm to assist in
estimating PT Freeport Indonesia’s asset retirement obligations, and FCX worked with other
consultants in estimating Atlantic Copper’s asset retirement obligations. FCX estimated these
obligations using an expected cash flow approach, in which multiple cash flow scenarios were used
to reflect a range of possible outcomes. As of January 1, 2003, FCX estimated these aggregate
obligations to be approximately $120 million for PT Freeport Indonesia and $17 million for Atlantic
Copper. To calculate the fair value of these obligations, FCX applied an estimated long-term inflation
rate of 2.5 percent, except for Indonesian rupiah-denominated labor costs with respect to PT
Freeport Indonesia's obligations, for which an estimated inflation rate of 9.0 percent was applied.
The projected cash flows were discounted at FCX’s estimated credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates
which ranged from 9.4 percent to 12.6 percent for the corresponding time periods over which these
costs would be incurred. After discounting the projected cash flows, a market risk premium of 10
percent was applied to the total to reflect what a third party might require to assume these asset
retirement obligations. The market risk premium was based on market-based estimates of rates that

43
a third party would have to pay to insure its exposure to possible future increases in the value of
these obligations.

At January 1, 2003, FCX estimated the fair value of its total asset retirement obligations to be
$28.5 million. FCX recorded the fair value of these obligations and the related additional assets as of
January 1, 2003. The net difference between FCX’s previously recorded reclamation and closure
cost liability and the amounts estimated under SFAS No. 143, after taxes and minority interest,
resulted in a gain of $9.1 million (after reduction by $8.5 million for taxes and minority interest
sharing), $0.06 per share on a diluted basis, which was recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment
for a change in accounting principle. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 143, FCX expects future
depreciation and amortization expense to be lower and production costs to be higher, with no
significant net impact on net income during the near term. Excluding the cumulative effect
adjustment, the net effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 was to increase net income by approximately $1
million, $0.01 per share, in 2003.

Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 143, estimated future reclamation and mine closure costs for
PT Freeport Indonesia’s current mining operations in Indonesia were accrued and charged to income
over the estimated life of the mine by the unit-of-production method based on estimated recoverable
proven and probable copper reserves. Estimated future closure costs for Atlantic Copper’s
operations were not considered material and no accruals were made. See Note 10 for further
discussion about FCX’s asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Income Taxes. FCX accounts for income taxes pursuant to SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes.” Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the future tax consequences of differences
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements
(see Note 8).

Pro Forma Net Income. Presented below (in thousands, except per share amounts) are FCX’s
reported results and pro forma amounts that would have been reported in FCX’s Consolidated
Statements of Income had those statements been adjusted for the retroactive application of the 2003
changes in accounting principles (SFAS No. 143 and SFAS No. 150) and the 2002 change in
depreciation methodology.

2003 2002

Actual reported results:

Net income applicable to common stock $ 154219 $ 127,050

Basic net income per share of common stock 0.99 0.88

Diluted net income per share of common stock 0.97 0.87
Pro forma amounts assuming retroactive application:

Net income applicable to common stock $ 169,307 $ 129,635

Basic net income per share of common stock 1.09 0.90

Diluted net income per share of common stock 1.06 0.89

Derivative Instruments. At times FCX and its subsidiaries have entered into derivative contracts to
manage certain risks resulting from fluctuations in commodity prices (primarily copper and gold),
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates by creating offsetting market exposures. FCX
accounts for derivatives pursuant to SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.”. SFAS No. 133, as subsequently amended, established accounting and reporting
standards requiring that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at its fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. See Note 11 fora
summary of FCX’s outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2004, and a discussion of
FCX’s risk management strategies for those designated as hedges.

FCX elected to continue its historical accounting for its redeemable preferred stock indexed
to commodities under the provisions of SFAS No. 133 which allow such instruments issued before
January 1, 1998, to be excluded from those instruments required to be adjusted for changes in their
fair values. Redeemable preferred stock indexed to commodities is treated as a hedge of future
production and is carried at its original issue value. As redemption payments occur, differences

44
between the carrying value and the payment are recorded as an adjustment to revenues (see Note
5).

Effective July 1, 2003, FCX adopted SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” On July 1, 2003, FCX reclassified its
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock totaling $450.0 million as debt and reclassified the $26.6
million of original issuance costs from capital in excess of par value of common stock to other assets.
FCX also recorded a $24.7 million ($0.16 per share) cumulative effect adjustment for the
amortization of the original issuance costs through July 1, 2003. Effective July 1, 2003, dividend
payments on FCX’s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock are classified as interest expense.
SFAS No. 150 does not permit prior period financial statements to be restated to reflect the changes
in classification. In addition to the cumulative effect adjustment, adopting SFAS No. 150 decreased
net income applicable to common stock by approximately $0.4 million, less than $0.01 per share, in
2003 for amortization after July 1 of original issuance costs.

Revenue Recognition. PT Freeport Indonesia’s sales of copper concentrates, which also contain
significant quantities of gold and silver, are recognized in revenues when the title to the concentrates
is transferred to the buyer (which coincides with the transfer of the risk of loss) at the point the
concentrates are moved over the vessel’s rail at PT Freeport Indonesia’s port facility.

Revenues from PT Freeport Indonesia's concentrate sales are recorded based on either 100
percent of a provisional sales price or a final sales price calculated in accordance with the terms
specified in the relevant sales contract. Revenues from concentrate sales are recorded net of
royalties, treatment and all refining charges (including price participation, if applicable) and the impact
of commodity contracts, including the impact of redemptions of FCX’s mandatorily redeemable
preferred stock indexed to commodities (see Notes 5 and 11). Moreover, because a portion of the
metals contained in copper concentrates is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, PT
Freeport Indonesia’s revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on
the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of PT
Freeport Indonesia’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent
payments to smelters and refiners and are either fixed or in certain cases vary with the price of
copper.

PT Freeport Indonesia’s concentrate sales agreements, including its sales to Atlantic Copper
and PT Smelting, provide for provisional billings based on world metals prices when shipped,
primarily using then-current prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Final settlement on the
copper portion is generally based on the average LME price for a specified future period, generally
three months after the month of arrival at the customer's facility. PT Freeport Indonesia’s
concentrate sales agreements do not allow for net settlement and always result in physical delivery.
Final delivery to customers in Asia generally takes up to 25 days and to customers in Europe
generally takes up to 57 days.

Under SFAS No. 133, PT Freeport Indonesia’s sales based on a provisional sales price
contain an embedded derivative which is required to be bifurcated from the host contract. The host
contract is the sale of the metals contained in the concentrates at the current spot LME price. PT
Freeport Indonesia applies the normal purchase and sale exception allowed by SFAS No. 133 to the
host contract in its concentrate sales agreements because the sales always result in physical
delivery. Revenues based on provisional sales prices totaled $391.5 million at December 31, 2004.
The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked-to-market through
earnings each period. At December 31, 2004, FCX had consolidated embedded copper derivatives
on 292.2 million pounds recorded at an average price of $1.45 per pound based on forward prices for
the expected settlement dates. All of these derivatives are expected to be finally priced during the
first half of 2005. The impact of fluctuations in the forward prices used for these derivatives through
the settlement date is reflected as derivative gains and losses in revenues. A two-cent movement in
the average price used for these derivatives would have an approximate $3 million impact on FCX’s
2005 net income. Gold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average
London Bullion Market Association price for a specified month near the month of shipment. At
December 31, 2004, FCX had consolidated embedded gold derivatives on 123,400 ounces recorded
at an average price of $438 per ounce. For 2004, 2003 and 2002, the maximum net price
adjustment to revenues after initial recognition was seven percent for copper revenues and two
percent for gold revenues.

45
PT Freeport Indonesia pays royalties under a Contract of Work (see Note 10). The copper
royalty rate payable by PT Freeport Indonesia under its Contract of Work varies from 1.5 percent of
copper net revenue at a copper price of $0.90 or less per pound to 3.5 percent at a copper price of
$1.10 or more per pound. The Contract of Work royalty rate for gold and silver sales is 1.0 percent.

A large part of the mineral royalties under Government of Indonesia regulations is designated
to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted. In connection with its fourth concentrator mill
expansion completed in 1998, PT Freeport Indonesia agreed to pay the Government of Indonesia
additional royalties (royalties not required by the Contract of Work) to provide further support to the
local governments and the people of the Indonesian province of Papua. The additional royalties are
paid on metal from production from PT Freeport Indonesia’s milling facilities above 200,000 metric
tons of ore per day. The additional royalty for copper equals the Contract of Work royalty rate, and
for gold and silver equals twice the Contract of Work royalty rates. Therefore, PT Freeport
Indonesia’s royalty rate on copper net revenues from production above 200,000 metric tons of ore
per day is double the Contract of Work royalty rate, and the royalty rates on gold and silver sales from
production above 200,000 metric tons of ore per day are triple the Contract of Work royalty rates.
The combined royalties, including the additional royalties, which became effective January 1, 1999,
totaled $43.5 million in 2004, $26.5 million in 2003 and $24.5 million in 2002.

Foreign Currencies. Transaction gains and losses associated with Atlantic Copper’s euro-
denominated and PT Freeport Indonesia’s rupiah-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are
included in net income. Atlantic Copper’s euro-denominated net monetary liabilities totaled $74.0
million at December 31, 2004, based on an exchange rate of $1.36 per euro. Excluding hedging
amounts, net Atlantic Copper foreign currency transaction losses totaled $1.6 million in 2004, $13.6
million in 2003 and $11.9 million in 2002. PT Freeport Indonesia’s rupiah-denominated net monetary
liabilities totaled $7.7 million at December 31, 2004, based on an exchange rate of 9,270 rupiah to
one U.S. dollar. Excluding hedging amounts, net PT Freeport Indonesia foreign currency transaction
losses totaled $0.7 million in 2004, $3.0 million in 2003 and $3.5 million in 2002.

Comprehensive Income. FCX follows SFAS No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” for the
reporting and display of comprehensive income (net income plus other comprehensive income, or all
other changes in net assets from nonowner sources) and its components. FCX’s comprehensive
income for 2004, 2003 and 2002 follows (in thousands):

2004 2003 2002
Net income $ 202,267 $ 181,660 $ 164,654
Other comprehensive income (loss):
Change in unrealized derivatives’ fair value, net
of taxes of $1.0 million for 2004 and $3.1
million for 2002 1,226 5,195 13,615
Reclass to earnings, net of taxes of $4.7 million
for 2002 1,448 (7,490) (1,468 )
Total comprehensive income $ 204,941 $ 179,365 $ 176,801

Effective January 1996, Atlantic Copper changed its functional currency from the peseta (the
Spanish currency at the time) to the U.S. dollar. This change resulted from significant changes in
Atlantic Copper’s operations related to a large expansion of its smelting and refining operations
financed with U.S. dollar borrowings and the sale of its mining operations that incurred significant
peseta operating costs. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income reported in the Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders’ Equity before 2001 totaled $10.2 million and consisted solely of the
cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment at Atlantic Copper prior to changing its functional
currency, for which there is no tax effect. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency
Translation,” the currency translation adjustment recorded up through the date of the change in
functional currency will only be adjusted in the event of a full or partial disposition of FCX’s
investment in Atlantic Copper.

Stock-Based Compensation. As of December 31, 2004, FCX has four stock-based employee
compensation plans and two stock-based director compensation plans, which are more fully
described in Note 7. FCX accounts for options granted under all of its plans under the recognition
and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations, which require compensation cost for stock-

46
based employee compensation plans to be recognized based on the difference on the date of grant,
if any, between the quoted market price of the stock and the amount an employee must pay to
acquire the stock. Because all the plans require that the option exercise price be at least the market
price on the date of grant, FCX recognizes no compensation expense on the grant or exercise of its
employees’ options. See “New Accounting Standards” below for a discussion of a recently issued
revision to SFAS No. 123, which FCX must adopt no later than July 1, 2005. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if FCX had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” which requires
compensation cost for all stock-based employee compensation plans to be recognized based ona

For the pro forma computations, the values of option grants were calculated on the dates of
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. No other discounts or restrictions related to
vesting or the likelihood of vesting of stock options were applied. The following table summarizes the
calculated average fair values and weighted-average assumptions used to determine the fair value of
FCX’s stock option grants under SFAS No. 123 during the periods presented.

2004 2003 2002
Fair value per stock option $ 15.15 $ 1030 $ 7.89

Earnings Per Share. FCX’s basic net income per share of common stock was calculated by dividing
net income applicable to common stock by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the year. The following is a reconciliation of net income and weighted-average
common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating diluted net income per share (in thousands,
except per share amounts):

2004 2003 2002
Net income before preferred dividends and cumulative effect
of changes in accounting principles $ 202,267 $ 197,253 $ 167,703
Preferred dividends (45,491 ) (27,441 ) (37,604 )

Outstanding stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of
FCX’s common stock during the year are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per
share of common stock. In addition, certain convertible instruments (see Notes 5 and 7) are
excluded because including the conversion of these instruments would have increased reported
diluted net income per share. A recap of the excluded amounts follows (in thousands, except
exercise prices):

million shares of common stock (see Note 5).

b. On March 30, 2004, FCX sold 1.1 million shares of 52% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock for $1.1
billion, with net proceeds totaling $1.067 billion (see Note 7).

c. 51.5 percent of FCX’s 8%% Convertible Senior Notes converted to FCX common stock in August 2003.
In January 2004, approximately 37 percent converted to FCX common stock and the remaining notes
converted to FCX common stock in July 2004 (see Note 5).

d. FCX’s Step-Up Convertible Preferred Stock was redeemed in December 2003 (see Note 7).

New Accounting Standards. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs,
an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” SFAS No. 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as
current-period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based
on the normal capacity of the production facilities. FCX must adopt SFAS No. 151 no later than
January 1, 2006. FCX has not yet determined when it will adopt SFAS No. 151; however, FCX
currently does not expect adoption to have a material impact on its accounting for inventory costs.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment.”
SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.

Through December 31, 2004, FCX accounted for grants of employee stock options under the
recognition principles of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related interpretations, which require compensation costs for stock-based employee compensation
plans to be recognized based on the difference on the date of grant, if any, between the quoted
market price of the stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. If FCX had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” which requires compensation cost for all stock-based employee compensation plans
to be recognized based on the use of a fair value method, FCX’s net income would have been
reduced by $5.2 million, $0.05 per diluted share, for 2004, $4.7 million, $0.05 per diluted share, for

48
2003 and $6.5 million, $0.07 per diluted share, for 2002 (see “Stock-Based Compensation”). FCX
must adopt SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) no later than July 1, 2005; however, FCX can elect to adopt
SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) as early as January 1, 2005. FCxX is still reviewing the provisions of
SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) and has not yet determined if it will adopt SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004)
before July 1, 2005. Also, stock options were granted to employees in February 2005, including
multi-year grants to senior executive officers. As a result, the annual charges for share-based
payments will be higher than the pro forma annual amounts presented under “Stock-Based
Compensation.” Based on currently outstanding employee stock options, including those granted in
February 2005, if FCX adopts SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) on July 1, 2005, FCX estimates the
charge to earnings before taxes and minority interest sharing in the second half of 2005 would total
approximately $11 million, and the reduction in net income would be approximately $6.5 million,
$0.04 per basic share using common shares outstanding at December 31, 2004.

NOTE 2. OWNERSHIP IN SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES WITH RIO TINTO

Ownership in Subsidiaries. FCX’s direct ownership in PT Freeport Indonesia totaled 81.3 percent
at December 31, 2004 and 2003. PT Indocopper Investama, an Indonesian company, owns 9.4
percent of PT Freeport Indonesia and FCX owns 100 percent of PT Indocopper Investama. In July
2004, FCX received a request from the Indonesian Department of Energy and Mineral Resources
that it offer to sell to Indonesian nationals shares in PT Indocopper Investama at fair market value. In
response to this request and in view of the potential benefits of having additional Indonesian
ownership in the project, FCX has agreed to consider a potential sale of an interest in PT Indocopper
Investama at fair market value. Neither its Contract of Work with the Indonesian government nor
Indonesian law requires FCX to divest any portion of its ownership in PT Freeport Indonesia or PT
Indocopper Investama. At December 31, 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia’s net assets totaled $2.3
billion and its retained earnings total $2.1 billion. As of December 31, 2004, FCX has two outstanding
loans to PT Freeport Indonesia totaling $192.4 million.

Substantially all of PT Freeport Indonesia’s assets are located in Indonesia. Events in
Indonesia during 2004 mainly centered on the national elections. The presidential election was
conducted peacefully and after a runoff, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was declared the new president
in October. Indonesia continues to face political, economic and social uncertainties, including
separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces.

FCX owns 100 percent of the outstanding Atlantic Copper common stock. At December 31,
2004, FCX’s net investment in Atlantic Copper totaled $97.4 million, FCX had $189.5 million of loans
outstanding to Atlantic Copper and Atlantic Copper’s debt under financing arrangements that are
nonrecourse to FCX totaled $12.3 million. Atlantic Copper is not expected to pay dividends in the
near future. Under the terms of its concentrate sales agreements with Atlantic Copper, PT Freeport
Indonesia had outstanding trade receivables from Atlantic Copper totaling $146.0 million at
December 31, 2004. FCX made cash contributions to Atlantic Copper totaling $202.0 million in 2004,
$10.0 million in 2003 and $25.0 million in 2002. These transactions had no impact on FCX’s
consolidated financial statements.

FCX owns 100 percent of FM Services Company. FM Services Company provides certain
administrative, financial and other services on a cost-reimbursement basis to FCX and provides
similar services to two other public companies under management services agreements with fixed
fee terms plus reimbursements for special projects and out-of-pocket expenses. The costs billed to
FCX and PT Freeport Indonesia, which include related overhead, totaled $34.6 million in 2004, $33.4
million in 2003 and $31.1 million in 2002. Management believes these costs do not differ materially
from the costs that would have been incurred had the relevant personnel providing these services
been employed directly by FCX. The amounts FM Services Company billed to the two other public
companies totaled $4.3 million during 2004, $3.6 million during 2003 and $2.6 million during 2002.
Long-term receivables from one of those companies totaled $3.2 million at December 31, 2004, and
relate to certain FM Services Company long-term employee benefit obligations.

In July 2003, FCX acquired the 85.7 percent ownership interest in Puncakjaya Power owned
by affiliates of Duke Energy Corporation for $78 million cash. Puncakjaya Power is the owner of
assets supplying power to PT Freeport Indonesia’s operations, including the 3x65 megawatt coal-
fired power facilities. PT Freeport Indonesia purchases power from Puncakjaya Power under
infrastructure asset financing arrangements. At December 31, 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia had
infrastructure asset financing obligations to Puncakjaya Power totaling $258.7 million and Puncakjaya
Power had a receivable from PT Freeport Indonesia for $340.1 million, including Rio Tinto’s share.
As a result of this transaction, FCX is now consolidating Puncakjaya Power and FCX’s consolidated

49
balance sheet no longer reflects PT Freeport Indonesia’s obligation to Puncakjaya Power or
Puncakjaya Power's receivable from PT Freeport Indonesia, but instead reflects the $187.0 million of
outstanding Puncakjaya Power bank debt at December 31, 2004, and a $73.5 million receivable
($11.5 million in other accounts receivable and $62.0 million in long-term assets) for Rio Tinto’s share
of Puncakjaya Power's receivable as provided for in FCX’s joint venture agreement with Rio Tinto.

Joint Ventures With Rio Tinto. In March 2004, FCX purchased Rio Tinto’s 23.9 million shares of
FCX common stock for $881.9 million (approximately $36.85 per share) with a portion of the
proceeds from the sale of the 512% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (see Note 7). Rio Tinto
acquired these shares from FCX’s former parent company in 1995 in connection with the spinoff of
FCX as an independent company. FCX and Rio Tinto have established certain unincorporated joint
ventures which are not impacted by FCX’s purchase of its shares from Rio Tinto discussed above.
Under the joint venture arrangements, Rio Tinto has a 40 percent interest in PT Freeport Indonesia’s
Contract of Work and Eastern Minerals’ Contract of Work, and the option to participate in 40 percent
of any other future exploration projects in Papua. Under the arrangements, Rio Tinto funded $100
million in 1996 for approved exploration costs in the areas covered by the PT Freeport Indonesia and
Eastern Minerals Contracts of Work. Agreed-upon exploration costs in the joint venture areas are
generally shared 60 percent by FCX and 40 percent by Rio Tinto.

Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, Rio Tinto has a 40 percent interest in certain assets
and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper, gold and silver through 2021 in
Block A of PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work, and, after 2021, a 40 percent interest in all
production from Block A. Operating, nonexpansion capital and administrative costs are shared
proportionately between PT Freeport Indonesia and Rio Tinto based on the ratio of (a) the
incremental revenues from production from PT Freeport Indonesia’s most recent expansion
completed in 1998 to (b) total revenues from production from Block A, including production from PT
Freeport Indonesia's previously existing reserves. PT Freeport Indonesia will continue to receive 100
percent of the cash flow from specified annual amounts of copper, gold and silver through 2021
calculated by reference to its proven and probable reserves as of December 31, 1994, and 60
percent of all remaining cash flow. The agreement provides for adjustments to the specified annual
amounts of copper, gold and silver attributable 100 percent to PT Freeport Indonesia upon the
occurrence of certain events which cause an extended interruption in production to occur, including
the events such as the fourth-quarter 2003 Grasberg open-pit slippage and debris flow. As a result
of the Grasberg slippage and debris flow events, the 2004 specified amounts attributable 100 percent
to PT Freeport Indonesia were reduced by 178 million pounds for copper and 280,000 ounces for
gold. These reductions were offset by increases in the specified amounts attributable to PT Freeport
Indonesia totaling 111 million pounds for copper and 175,000 ounces for gold in 2005, and 67 million
pounds for copper and 105,000 ounces for gold in 2021.

the capital stock of PT Indocopper Investama, $34.5 million related to PT Freeport Indonesia’s
issuance of its shares to FCX in 1993 and 1994 to settle a convertible loan due to FCX and $268.4
million related to FCX’s acquisition of the remaining 51 percent of the capital stock of PT Indocopper
Investama in February 2002. These costs relate to the value of the proven and probable reserves
FCX acquired and are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated
recoverable proven and probable copper reserves. Additionally, other costs include $20.8 million
related to FCX’s acquisition of Atlantic Copper in 1993 and relate to its smelter assets. These costs
are amortized using the straight-line method based on the estimated life of Atlantic Copper’s smelter
assets.

Notes Payable. As discussed in Note 2, FCX acquired the 85.7 percent ownership interest in
Puncakjaya Power owned by affiliates of Duke Energy Corporation in July 2003. Puncakjaya Power’s
bank debt is secured by the power-related assets operated by Puncakjaya Power.

At December 31, 2003, FCX and PT Freeport Indonesia had vendor-financed equipment
loans secured by certain PT Freeport Indonesia assets. The FCX loan had a $19.3 million balance.

51
PT Freeport Indonesia had three equipment loans with this vendor ($43.4 million outstanding at
December 31, 2003) and had capital leases with this vendor totaling $47.6 million at December 31,
2003. Interest rates on all of the equipment loans and the leases are variable. In 2004, FCX and PT
Freeport Indonesia paid the outstanding balances of their loans and PT Freeport Indonesia had
capital leases totaling $72.5 million at December 31, 2004.

Atlantic Copper has a variable-rate project loan (the Atlantic Copper facility). In February
2004, FCX used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the 6%% Senior Notes (see below) to
repay $162.4 million of Atlantic Copper’s borrowings and to refinance certain other FCX debt
maturities. Atlantic Copper recorded a $3.7 million charge for losses on early extinguishment of debt
for repayment of certain of its debt. As of December 31, 2004, the variable-rate project loan,
nonrecourse to FCX, consisted of a $50.0 million working capital revolver ($4.4 million outstanding at
December 31, 2004) that matures December 2007. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the
commitment was reduced to $44.0 million. The Atlantic Copper facility restricts other borrowings and
borrowings under the facility are secured by certain Atlantic Copper receivables and inventory.
Atlantic Copper’s other working capital revolver required 20 percent of amounts borrowed under the
facility to be deposited in a restricted account which totaled $11.0 million at December 31, 2003.

FCX and PT Freeport Indonesia have a $195 million revolving credit facility, which matures in
September 2006. The facility sets limitations on liens and limitations on transactions with affiliates,
and requires that certain financial ratios be maintained. The credit facility allows common stock
dividends, common stock purchases and investments as long as availability under the facility plus
available cash exceeds $200 million or otherwise as long as certain other thresholds are exceeded.
Security for obligations outstanding under the credit facility includes over 80 percent of PT Freeport
Indonesia’s assets, 50.1 percent of the outstanding stock of PT Freeport Indonesia, the outstanding
stock of PT Indocopper Investama owned by FCX, and a pledge of PT Freeport Indonesia’s rights
under its Contract of Work (see Note 10). PT Freeport Indonesia and FCX guarantee each other’s
obligations under the credit facility. No amounts are currently outstanding under the facility. FCX and
PT Freeport Indonesia recorded charges to other expense totaling $5.6 million, $3.7 million to net
income, in 2003 to accelerate amortization of deferred financing costs related to the prior credit
facility.

Senior Notes. In February 2003, FCX sold $575 million of 7% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011
for net proceeds of $559.1 million. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually on March 1 and
September 1 of each year, beginning September 1, 2003. The notes are convertible, at the option of
the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of FCX’s common stock at a conversion
price of $30.87 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 32.39 shares of
common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. The notes are unsecured.

In January 2003, FCX sold $500 million of 10%% Senior Notes due 2010 for net proceeds of
$487.3 million. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each
year, beginning August 1, 2003. FCX may redeem some or all of the notes at its option at a make-
whole redemption price prior to February 1, 2007, and afterwards at stated redemption prices. The
indenture governing the notes contains restrictions and limitations on incurring debt, creating liens,
entering into sale leaseback transactions, taking actions to limit distributions from certain
subsidiaries, selling assets, entering into certain transactions with affiliates, paying cash dividends on
common stock, repurchasing or redeeming common or preferred equity, prepaying subordinated debt
and making investments. The notes are unsecured.

In February 2004, FCX sold $350 million of 6%% Senior Notes due 2014 for net proceeds of
$344.4 million. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each
year, beginning August 1, 2004. FCX may redeem some or all of the notes at its option at a make-
whole redemption price prior to February 1, 2009, and afterwards at stated redemption prices. The
indenture governing the notes contains certain restrictions, including restrictions on incurring debt,
creating liens, selling assets, entering into certain transactions with affiliates, paying cash dividends
on common stock, repurchasing or redeeming common or preferred equity, prepaying subordinated
debt and making investments. During the second quarter of 2004, FCX purchased in the open
market $9.7 million of the 67% Senior Notes for $8.8 million, which, including deferred financing
costs, resulted in a gain of $0.8 million recorded as a reduction to losses on early extinguishment and
conversion of debt.

In April 2003, FCX concluded tender offers for its 7.20% Senior Notes due 2026 and its
7.50% Senior Notes due 2006. Of the total $450 million outstanding at December 31, 2002, notes

52
with a face amount of $234.0 million were tendered for $239.0 million cash. FCX recorded a charge
of $6.6 million ($4.8 million to net income) to losses on early extinguishments of debt. In July 2003,
FCX purchased an additional $76.0 million face amount of its 7.20% Senior Notes for $77.2 million,
and recorded a charge to losses on early extinguishment of debt of $1.3 million ($0.9 million to net
income). In October 2003, holders of $68.9 million of 7.20% Senior Notes elected early repayment
as permitted under their terms. At December 31, 2004, FCX had outstanding $66.5 million of its
7.50% Senior Notes and $4.5 million of its 7.20% Senior Notes.

During the first quarter of 2004, FCX completed a tender offer and privately negotiated
transactions for a portion of its remaining 814% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006 resulting in the
early conversion of $226.1 million of notes into 15.8 million shares of FCX common stock. FCX
recorded a $10.9 million charge to losses on early extinguishment and conversion of debt in the first
quarter of 2004 in connection with these conversions. The $10.9 million charge included $6.4 million
of previously accrued interest costs that were reversed, resulting in an equivalent reduction to interest
expense. In June 2004, the remaining $66.5 million of notes were called for redemption on July 31,
2004. During July, all of these notes were converted into 4.7 million shares of FCX’s common stock.
As of July 31, 2004, all of the 8%% Convertible Notes, which totaled $603.8 million at issuance in
2001, had been converted into 42.2 million shares of FCX common stock.

Redeemable Preferred Stock. As discussed in Note 1, upon adoption of SFAS No. 150 on July 1,
2003, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock totaling $450.0 million was reclassified as debt. On
August 1, 2003, FCX redeemed the 6.0 million depositary shares representing its Gold-Denominated
Preferred Stock for $210.5 million. The mandatory redemption of the Gold-Denominated Preferred
Stock shares reduced total consolidated debt by $232.6 million and resulted in a hedging gain to
revenues of $22.1 million in 2003.

FCX has outstanding 4.3 million depositary shares representing 215,279 shares of its Gold-
Denominated Preferred Stock, Series II totaling $167.4 million. Each depositary share has a
cumulative quarterly cash dividend equal to the value of 0.0008125 ounce of gold and is mandatorily
redeemable in February 2006 for the cash value of 0.1 ounce of gold. These depositary shares trade
on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “FCX PrC.”

FCX has outstanding 4.8 million depositary shares representing 29,750 shares of its Silver-
Denominated Preferred Stock totaling $25.0 million at December 31, 2004, and had 44,625 shares
totaling $37.5 million at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, each depositary share has a
cumulative quarterly cash dividend equal to the value of 0.01031 ounce of silver, which will decline by
50 percent after the next scheduled redemption payment. FCX made six annual mandatory partial
redemption payments on the underlying Silver-Denominated Preferred Stock through August 2004.
For each of the partial redemptions, the difference between FCX’s carrying amount of $12.5 million
and the actual redemption payments was recorded in revenues as a hedging gain or loss. On August
1, 2004, FCX made the sixth of eight scheduled annual redemption payments on its Silver-
Denominated Preferred Stock for $13.9 million. The mandatory redemptions resulted in hedging
gains (losses) to revenues of $(1.4) million in 2004, $1.7 million in 2003 and $0.8 million in 2002.
Two annual redemption payments remain and will vary with the price of silver. These depositary
shares trade on the NYSE under the symbol “FCX PrD.”

NOTE 7. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Common Stock. FCX has 473.6 million authorized shares of capital stock consisting of 423.6 million
shares of common stock and 50.0 million shares of preferred stock. At the 2002 annual shareholder
meeting, FCX’s shareholders approved the conversion of each outstanding share of Class A
common stock into one share of Class B common stock. FCX now has only one class of common
stock. The conversion created a new measurement date for FCX’s Class A stock options that were
converted to Class B stock options. Under accounting rules followed by FCX for stock-based
compensation, the in-the-money value of these stock options on the new measurement date ($8.8
million) must be charged to earnings over the remaining vesting period of the options, which extends
through January 2006. The related charge to general and administrative expenses totaled $2.1
million in 2004, $2.3 million in 2003 and $1.6 million in 2002.

In 2003, FCX’s Board of Directors approved a new open market share purchase program for
up to 20 million shares, which replaced FCX’s previous program. Under this new program, FCX
acquired 3.4 million shares during the second quarter of 2004 for $99.5 million, $29.39 per share
average, and 16.6 million shares remain available. No other shares were purchased through
February 28, 2005. The timing of future purchases of FCX’s common stock is dependent on many
factors including the price of FCX’s common shares, FCX’s cash flow and financial position, and
general economic and market conditions.

Preferred Stock. In December 2003, FCX called for redemption the depositary shares representing
its Step-Up Convertible Preferred Stock. Of the 14.0 million depositary shares outstanding at the
time of call, 13.8 million depositary shares converted into 11.5 million shares of FCX common stock.
The remaining depositary shares outstanding were redeemed for approximately $7 million in cash.

In March 2004, FCX sold 1.1 million shares of 5%% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock
for $1.1 billion, with net proceeds totaling $1.067 billion. Each share of preferred stock was initially
convertible into 18.8019 shares of FCX common stock, equivalent to a conversion price of
approximately $53.19 per common share. The conversion rate is adjustable upon the occurrence of
certain events, including any quarter that FCX’s common stock dividend exceeds $0.20 per share. In
October 2004, FCX’s Board of Directors increased the annual common stock dividend rate to $1.00
per share ($0.25 per share quarterly). In December 2004, the Board authorized a supplemental
common stock dividend of $0.25 per share, which was paid on December 29, 2004. The increased
quarterly dividend payments and the supplemental dividend resulted in adjustments to the conversion
rate. After FCX’s February 2005 quarterly dividend, each share of preferred stock is now convertible
into 18.9794 shares of FCX common stock, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $52.69
per common share. In February 2005, the Board authorized a supplemental common stock dividend
of $0.50 per share payable on March 31, 2005, which will result in another adjustment to the
conversion price in March 2005. Beginning March 30, 2009, FCX may redeem shares of the
preferred stock by paying cash, FCX common stock or any combination thereof for $1,000 per share
plus unpaid dividends, but only if FCX’s common stock price has exceeded 130 percent of the
conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the notice of redemption. FCX used a portion of the proceeds from the sale to
purchase 23.9 million shares of FCX common stock owned by Rio Tinto for $881.9 million
(approximately $36.85 per share) and used the remainder for general corporate purposes.

Stock Award Plans. FCX currently has six stock-based compensation plans. FCX’s Adjusted Stock
Award Plan provided for the issuance of certain stock awards to employees, officers and directors of
Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FTX), the former parent of FCX, in connection with FTX’s distribution of
FCX shares to its shareholders in 1995. Under this plan, FCX made a one-time grant of awards to
purchase up to 10.7 million common shares, including SARs, at prices equivalent to the original FTX
price at date of grant as adjusted for the proportionate market value of FCX shares at the time of the
distribution. All options granted under this plan expire 10 years from the original FTX date of grant.

FCX’s 1995 Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options and other stock-
based awards (including SARs) for up to 10.0 million common shares at no less than market value at
the time of grant. FCX’s 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors authorizes FCX to
grant options to purchase up to 2.0 million shares and to grant up to 1.3 million SARs.

FCX’s 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1999 Plan) and 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2003
Plan) provide for the issuance of stock options, SARs, restricted stock units and other stock-based

54
awards. Each plan allows FCX to grant awards for up to 8.0 million common shares to eligible
participants and also allows FCX senior executives to elect to receive restricted stock units in place
of all or part of their cash incentive compensation. Restricted stock unit grants vest over three years
and are valued on the date of grant at 50 percent above the cash incentive compensation they
replace. FCX granted 0.2 million shares of restricted stock units in 2004 and 0.1 million shares in
each of 2003 and 2002.

In May 2004, FCX’s shareholders approved the “2004 Director Compensation Plan” (the
2004 Plan). The 2004 Plan authorizes awards of options and restricted stock units for up to 1.0
million shares and the one-time grant of 66,882 SARs.

Awards granted under all of the plans generally expire 10 years after the date of grant and
vest in 25 percent annual increments beginning one year from the date of grant. Awards for 0.7
million shares under the 2004 Plan, 6.7 million shares under the 2003 Plan and 0.1 million shares
under the 1999 Plan were available for new grants as of December 31, 2004. A summary of stock

Plan to purchase a total of 2.6 million shares of FCX stock at $19.03 per share. The options were

FCX has provided a valuation allowance equal to its tax credit carryforwards ($509.6 million
at December 31, 2004, and $466.0 million at December 31, 2003) as these would only be used
should FCX be required to pay regular U.S. tax, which is considered unlikely for the foreseeable
future and because the foreign tax credits expire after ten years. Atlantic Copper is subject to
taxation in Spain and has not generated significant taxable income in recent years. FCX has
provided a valuation allowance equal to the future tax benefits resulting from Atlantic Copper’s net
operating losses totaling $423.8 million at December 31, 2004, and $282.6 million at December 31,
2003, which expire through the year 2019.

NOTE 9. INVESTMENT IN PT SMELTING AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

PT Smelting. PT Smelting, an Indonesian company, operates a smelter/refinery in Gresik,
Indonesia. In 2004, PT Smelting increased its stated production capacity of 200,000 metric tons of
copper metal per year to 250,000 metric tons. PT Freeport Indonesia, Mitsubishi Materials
Corporation (Mitsubishi Materials), Mitsubishi Corporation (Mitsubishi) and Nippon Mining & Metals
Co., Ltd. (Nippon) own 25 percent, 60.5 percent, 9.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of the

56
outstanding PT Smelting common stock. PT Freeport Indonesia provides nearly all of PT Smelting’s
copper concentrate requirements. Under the PT Smelting contract, for the first 15 years of PT
Smelting’s commercial operations beginning December 1998, the treatment and refining charges on
the majority of the concentrate PT Freeport Indonesia provides will not fall below specified minimum
rates, subject to renegotiation in 2008. The rate was $0.23 per pound during the period from the
commencement of PT Smelting’s operations in 1998 until April 2004, when it declined to a minimum
of $0.21 per pound. In December 2003, PT Smelting’s shareholder agreement was amended to
eliminate PT Freeport Indonesia’s assignment of its earnings in PT Smelting to support a 13 percent
cumulative annual return to Mitsubishi Materials, Mitsubishi and Nippon for the first 20 years of
commercial operations. No amounts were paid under this assignment. PT Smelting had project-
specific debt, nonrecourse to PT Freeport Indonesia, totaling $259.5 million at December 31, 2004,
and $283.1 million at December 31, 2003.

Pension Plans. During 2000, FCX and FM Services Company elected to terminate their defined
benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. and certain overseas expatriate employees and
replace these plans, which have substantially the same provisions, with defined contribution plans, as
further discussed below. All participants’ account balances in the defined benefit plans were fully
vested on June 30, 2000, and interest credits continue to accrue under the plans until the assets are
finally liquidated. The final distribution will occur once approved by the Internal Revenue Service and
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The plans’ investment portfolios were liquidated and
invested in primarily short duration fixed-income securities in the fourth quarter of 2000 to reduce
exposure to equity market volatility. All of the FCX plan assets shown in the table below relate to
these plans and the unfunded liability totaled $2.2 million at December 31, 2004.

In February 2004, FCX established an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(SERP) for its two most senior executive officers. The SERP provides for retirement benefits payable
in the form of a joint and survivor annuity or an equivalent lump sum. The annuity will equal a
percentage of the executive’s highest average compensation for any consecutive three-year period
during the five years immediately preceding the earlier of the executive’s retirement or completion of
25 years of credited service. The SERP benefit will be reduced by the value of all benefits due under
FCX’s cash-balance pension plan and all other benefit plans sponsored by FCX or any other
predecessor employer. Unrecognized prior service cost at inception of the SERP totaled $18.9
million and is being amortized over the five-year term of the executive officers’ current employment
agreements. FCX also has an unfunded pension plan for its directors.

PT Freeport Indonesia has a defined benefit pension plan denominated in Indonesian
rupiahs covering substantially all of its Indonesian national employees. PT Freeport Indonesia funds
the plan and invests the assets in accordance with Indonesian pension guidelines. The pension
obligation was valued at an exchange rate of 9,270 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2004,
and 8,437 rupiah to one U.S. dollar on December 31, 2003. Labor laws enacted in 2003, which
replace labor laws enacted in 2001, in Indonesia require that companies provide a minimum level of
benefits to employees upon employment termination based on the reason for termination and the
employee’s years of service. PT Freeport Indonesia’s pension benefit disclosures for 2003, as
shown below, include the impact of this law as a $5.0 million increase in the benefit obligation and a
component of unrecognized prior service cost being amortized over an approximate 11-year period.

Atlantic Copper has a contractual obligation denominated in euros to supplement amounts
paid to certain retired Spanish national employees. Amended Spanish legislation required that
Atlantic Copper begin funding its contractual obligation to the retired employees through a third party
in November 2002. In August 2002, Atlantic Copper complied with the amended Spanish legislation
by agreeing to fund 7.2 million euros annually for 15 years to an approved insurance company for its
estimated 72 million euro contractual obligation to the retired employees. The insurance company
invests the plan assets in accordance with Spanish regulations and Atlantic Copper has no control
over these investments. Atlantic Copper is amortizing the unrecognized net actuarial loss over the
remaining 12-year funding period.

and any unfunded benefits will be paid after Internal Revenue Service and Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation approval. The expected benefit payments for FCX’s SERP and director plan total $0.2
million for each year in the period 2005 through 2008, $15.4 million in 2009 and $14.4 million
thereafter. The rupiah benefit payments that are expected to be paid for PT Freeport Indonesia's
pension plan (based on a December 31, 2004, exchange rate of 9,270 Indonesian rupiah to one U.S.
dollar) total $3.8 million in 2005, $3.4 million in 2006, $4.0 million in 2007, $5.1 million in 2008, $6.0
million in 2009 and $30.9 million for 2010 through 2014. Atlantic Copper’s plan is administered by a
third-party insurance company and Atlantic Copper is not provided asset allocations or benefit
payment projections.

Other Benefits. FCX and FM Services Company also provide certain health care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees. FCX and FM Services Company have the right to modify or terminate
these benefits. The initial health care cost trend rate used for the other benefits was 10 percent for
2005, decreasing ratably each year until reaching 5 percent in 2010. A one-percentage-point
increase or decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would not have a significant impact on
total service or interest cost. Information on the employee health care and life insurance benefits

FCX and FM Services Company have employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code that generally allow eligible employees to contribute up to 50 percent of their
pre-tax compensation, but no more than a specified annual limit (currently $14,000). FCX and FM
Services Company match 100 percent of the first 5 percent of the employees’ contribution. New plan
participants vest 100 percent in FCX’s and FM Services Company's matching contributions upon
three years of service.

During 2000, FCX and FM Services Company also established additional defined
contribution plans for substantially all their employees following their decision to terminate their
defined benefit pension plans. Under these plans, FCX and FM Services Company contribute
amounts to individual accounts totaling either 4 percent or 10 percent of each employee’s pay,
depending on a combination of each employee’s age and years of service. The costs charged to
operations for FCX’s and, since October 1, 2002, FM Services Company's employee savings plans
and defined contribution plans totaled $3.2 million in 2004, $2.8 million in 2003 and $1.2 million in
2002. FCX and FM Services Company have other employee benefit plans, certain of which are
related to FCX’s performance, which costs are recognized currently in general and administrative
expense. Atlantic Copper has a defined contribution plan and recorded charges totaling $0.5 million
in 2004, $0.4 million in 2003 and $0.3 million in 2002 for annual service costs related to this plan.

During 2004, Atlantic Copper undertook a cost reduction and operational enhancement plan
designed to reduce unit costs, including a reduction in workforce, and enhance operational and

60
administrative efficiencies. In connection with implementing this cost reduction and operational
enhancement plan, Atlantic Copper submitted a workforce reduction plan to the Spanish Labour
Authority and, in December 2004, received approval for this workforce reduction plan. Atlantic
Copper recorded a $12.0 million charge in 2004 related to the workforce reduction under this plan.
These charges include $8.1 million in one-time termination benefits for those affected employees
eligible for early retirement benefits, $0.8 million in severance payments for those affected employees
not eligible for early retirement and $3.1 million for contract termination costs. Atlantic Copper paid
$1.4 million of these benefits in December 2004 and expects to pay the balance in the first quarter of
2005.

NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Grasberg Open-Pit Slippage Events. On October 9, 2003, a slippage of material occurred in a
section of the Grasberg open pit, resulting in eight fatalities. On December 12, 2003, a debris flow
involving a relatively small amount of loose material occurred in the same section of the open pit
resulting in only minor property damage. All material involved in the affected mining areas has been
removed. The events caused PT Freeport Indonesia to alter its short-term mine sequencing plans
and to focus its open-pit operations on accelerating the removal of overburden from the south wall to
restore safe access to high-grade ore areas in the pit. In April 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia
established safe access and initiated mining in higher-grade ore areas while continuing overburden
removal activities. While PT Freeport Indonesia resumed normal milling rates in June 2004, no
assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future.

As a result of the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events, PT Freeport Indonesia
notified its copper concentrate customers that it was declaring force majeure under the terms of its
contracts as it would be unable to satisfy its annual sales and delivery commitments. In December
2004, PT Freeport Indonesia terminated the force majeure that had been in effect since December
2003 under its concentrate sales contracts.

PT Freeport Indonesia maintains property damage and business interruption insurance
related to its operations. FCX and its insurers entered into an insurance settlement agreement in
December 2004 (Settlement Agreement). Under the Settlement Agreement, all claims that arose
from the fourth-quarter 2003 slippage and debris flow events in the Grasberg open-pit mine were
settled. The insurers agreed to pay an aggregate of $125.0 million, inclusive of interest and the
$20.0 million previously paid to PT Freeport Indonesia in the third quarter of 2004, in connection with
its claims. Through December 31, 2004, the insurers had paid $94.5 million and the remaining $30.5
million was paid in January 2005. After considering its joint venture partner’s interest in the proceeds,
PT Freeport Indonesia’s joint venture share of proceeds totaled $95.0 million. As a result of the
settlement, FCX recorded on its income statement an $87.0 million gain on insurance settlement for
the business interruption recovery and an $8.0 million gain to production costs for the property loss
recovery for a net gain of $48.8 million, after taxes and minority interest sharing, in 2004.

Environmental, Reclamation and Mine Closure. FCX has an environmental policy committing it
not only to compliance with federal, state and local environmental statutes and regulations, but also
to continuous improvement of its environmental performance at every operational site. FCX believes
that its operations are being conducted pursuant to applicable permits and are in compliance in all
material respects with applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations. FCX incurred aggregate
environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs, including Rio Tinto’s share,
totaling $65.1 million in 2004, $72.1 million in 2003 and $62.6 million in 2002.

The ultimate amount of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred at PT Freeport
Indonesia’s operations will be determined based on applicable laws and regulations and PT Freeport
Indonesia’s assessment of appropriate remedial activities in the circumstances, after consultation
with governmental authorities, affected local residents and other affected parties and cannot currently
be projected with precision. Estimates of the ultimate reclamation and closure costs PT Freeport
Indonesia will incur in the future involve complex issues requiring integrated assessments over a
period of many years and are subject to revision over time as more complete studies are performed.
Some reclamation costs will be incurred during mining activities, while most closure costs and the
remaining reclamation costs will be incurred at the end of mining activities, which are currently
estimated to continue for more than 35 years.

Effective January 1, 2003, FCX adopted SFAS No. 143 (see Note 1). At December 31, 2004
and 2003, PT Freeport Indonesia revised its reclamation and closure estimates for (1) changes in the
projected timing of certain reclamation costs, (2) changes in certain cost estimates and (3) additional

61
asset retirement obligations incurred during 2003. At December 31, 2004, FCX estimated these
aggregate obligations to be approximately $149 million for PT Freeport Indonesia and $18 million for
Atlantic Copper, and estimated PT Freeport Indonesia’s aggregate discounted asset retirement
obligations to be $22.0 million and Atlantic Copper’s to be $0.8 million. At December 31, 2003, FCX
estimated these aggregate obligations to be approximately $130 million for PT Freeport Indonesia
and $17 million for Atlantic Copper, and estimated PT Freeport Indonesia’s aggregate discounted
asset retirement obligations to be $25.7 million and Atlantic Copper’s to be $0.8 million. The changes
reduced the related asset balances and are not expected to have a material impact on future net
income. A rollforward of FCX’s consolidated discounted asset retirement obligations for 2004 and
2003 follows (in thousands):

2004 2003
Asset retirement obligation at beginning of year $ 26,486 $ 28,485
Liabilities incurred : 605
Liabilities settled - (1,222 )
Accretion expense 2,985 2,852
Revision for changes in estimates (6,698) (4,333 )
Foreign exchange loss 75 99
Asset retirement obligation at end of year $ 22,848 $ 26,486

In 1996, PT Freeport Indonesia began contributing to a cash fund ($6.0 million balance at
December 31, 2004) designed to accumulate at least $100 million (including interest) by the end of its
Indonesian mining activities. PT Freeport Indonesia plans to use this fund, including accrued
interest, to pay the above-mentioned mine closure and reclamation costs. Any costs in excess of the
$100 million fund would be funded by operational cash flow or other sources. Future changes in
regulations could require FCX to incur additional costs that would be charged against future
operations. Estimates involving environmental matters are by their nature imprecise and can be
expected to be revised over time because of changes in government regulations, operations,
technology and inflation.

Contract of Work. FCX is entitled to mine in Indonesia under the “Contract of Work” between PT
Freeport Indonesia and the Government of Indonesia. The original Contract of Work was entered
into in 1967 and was replaced with a new Contract of Work in 1991. The initial term of the current
Contract of Work expires in 2021, but can be extended by PT Freeport Indonesia for two 10-year
periods, subject to Indonesian government approval, which cannot be withheld or delayed
unreasonably. Given the importance of contracts of work under the Indonesian legal system and PT
Freeport Indonesia’s over 35 years of working with the Indonesian government, which included
entering into the Contract of Work in 1991 well before the expiration of the 1967 Contract of Work,
PT Freeport Indonesia fully expects that the government will approve the extensions as long as it
continues to comply with the terms of the Contract of Work.

Social and Economic Development Programs. FCX has a comprehensive social, employment
and human rights policy to ensure that its operations are conducted in a manner respecting basic
human rights, the laws and regulations of the host country, and the culture of the people who are
indigenous to the areas in which FCX operates. In 1996, PT Freeport Indonesia established the
Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development, which was previously called the Freeport
Fund for lrian Jaya Development, through which PT Freeport Indonesia has made available funding
and expertise to support the economic and social development of the area. PT Freeport Indonesia
has committed to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people
through the Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development. PT Freeport Indonesia charged
$17.5 million in 2004, $17.4 million in 2003 and $15.2 million in 2002 to production costs for this
commitment.

Long-Term Contracts and Operating Leases. Atlantic Copper has firm contractual commitments
with parties other than PT Freeport Indonesia to purchase concentrate totaling 415,000 metric tons in
2005, 384,000 metric tons in 2006, 275,000 metric tons in 2007 and 160,000 metric tons in 2008 at
market prices.

As of December 31, 2004, FCX’s aggregate minimum annual contractual payments,
including Rio Tinto’s share, under noncancelable long-term operating leases which extend to 2030
totaled $7.6 million in 2005, $6.8 million in 2006, $6.7 million in 2007, $6.6 million in 2008, $6.0

62
million in 2009 and $6.2 million thereafter. Minimum payments under operating leases have not been
reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals of $1.1 million due under noncancelable subleases.
Total aggregate rental expense under operating leases amounted to $7.9 million in 2004, $6.6 million
in 2003 and $2.4 million in 2002.

Share Purchase Program. In June 2000, FCX’s Board of Directors authorized a 20-million-share
increase in FCX’s open market share purchase program, bringing the total shares approved for
purchase under this program to 80 million. From inception of this program in July 1995 through
October 2003, FCX has purchased a total of 70.7 million shares for $1.24 billion (an average of
$17.53 per share). In October 2003, FCX’s Board of Directors approved a new open market share
purchase program for up to 20 million shares which replaced the previous program. The timing of
future purchases of common stock is dependent upon many factors including the price of FCX’s
common shares, its cash flow and financial position, and general economic and market conditions.
As discussed in Note 5, two of FCX’s senior notes and, in certain circumstances, FCX’s credit facility
contain limitations on common stock purchases. In 2004, FCX purchased 3.4 million shares of its
common stock for $99.5 million ($29.39 per share average) under its 20-million-share purchase
program, of which 16.6 million shares remain available.

Contingencies For Non-Income Taxes. Atlantic Copper and PT Freeport Indonesia accrue and
pay certain non-income taxes and other government charges, such as value-added, withholding,
payroll, local and other taxes and charges. For certain transactions, issues arise as to the
applicability of these other taxes and charges. Based on management's review and prior experience,
a reserve for the estimated liability has been established (see Note 6).

NOTE 11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FCX and its subsidiaries have entered into derivative contracts in limited instances to achieve specific
objectives. Currently, these objectives principally relate to managing risks associated with foreign
currency and commodity price risks. In addition, in response to volatility in the Indonesian rupiah and
Australian dollar currencies, FCX has sought to manage certain foreign currency risks with PT
Freeport Indonesia’s mining operations. In the past, FCX has also entered into derivative contracts
related to PT Freeport Indonesia’s exposure to copper and gold prices, but activities in this regard
since 1997 have been limited to establishing fixed prices for open copper sales under PT Freeport
Indonesia’s concentrate sales contracts. FCX does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative
purposes.

Summarized below are financial instruments whose carrying amounts are not equal to their
fair value and unmatured derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2004 and 2003 (in
thousands). Fair values are based on quoted market prices and other available market information.

that qualify as hedges are not reported in current earnings, but are included in other comprehensive
income (see Note 1). A recap of gains (losses) charged to earnings for redeemable preferred stock

Commodity Contracts. From time to time, PT Freeport Indonesia has entered into forward and
option contracts to hedge the market risk associated with fluctuations in the prices of commodities it
sells. The primary objective of these contracts has been to set a minimum price and the secondary
objective is to retain market upside, if available at a reasonable cost. As of December 31, 2004, FCX
had no price protection contracts relating to its mine production. FCX has outstanding gold-
denominated and silver-denominated redeemable preferred stock with dividends and redemption
amounts determined by commodity prices. FCX elected to continue its historical accounting for its
redeemable preferred stock indexed to commodities under the provisions of SFAS No. 133 which
allow such instruments issued before January 1, 1998, to be excluded from those instruments
required to be adjusted for changes in their fair values. Therefore, FCX’s redeemable preferred
stock is recorded at its original issue value less redemptions, and totaled $192.4 million at December
31, 2004 (see Note 5).

Certain of PT Freeport Indonesia’s concentrate sales contracts allow for final pricing in future
periods. Under SFAS No. 133, these pricing terms cause a portion of the contracts to be considered
embedded derivatives, which must be recorded at fair value. PT Freeport Indonesia adjusts its
revenues for these embedded derivatives to reflect fair value based on forward prices for the final
pricing periods on each reporting date. Changes in the fair value of these embedded derivatives are
recorded in current period revenues.

Atlantic Copper enters into forward copper contracts designed to hedge its copper price risk
whenever its physical purchases and sales pricing periods do not match. Although these contracts
are intended to hedge against changes in copper prices, they do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment under SFAS No. 133 because Atlantic Copper bases its hedging contracts on its net sales
and purchases position, and contracts to hedge a net position do not qualify for hedge accounting
under SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2004, Atlantic Copper held forward copper sales contracts
for 12.7 million pounds at an average price of $1.40 per pound through March 2005.

Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts. PT Freeport Indonesia and Atlantic Copper enter into
foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the market risks of their forecasted costs denominated in
a currency other than the U.S. dollar, their functional currency. The primary objective of these
contracts is either to lock in an exchange rate or to minimize the impact of adverse exchange rate
changes. As of December 31, 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia had foreign currency contracts to hedge
450.0 billion in rupiah payments from April 2005 through December 2005, or approximately 32
percent of aggregate projected rupiah payments for 2005, at an average exchange rate of 10,059
rupiah to one U.S. dollar. PT Freeport Indonesia accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges.
As of December 31, 2004, PT Freeport Indonesia expects to reclass $2.9 million of unrealized gains
to 2005 earnings related to its outstanding foreign currency contracts.

Debt and Interest Rate Contracts. Atlantic Copper entered into interest rate swaps to manage
exposure to interest rate changes on a portion of its variable-rate debt. The primary objective of
these contracts is to lock in an interest rate considered to be favorable. Under the terms of its swaps,
Atlantic Copper will pay 3.6 percent on $36.5 million in the first quarter of 2005. Interest on
comparable floating rate debt averaged 3.6 percent in 2004, 4.4 percent in 2003 and 1.9 percent in
2002, resulting in additional interest costs totaling $1.4 million in 2004, $2.1 million in 2003 and $3.2
million in 2002.

Atlantic Copper is a party to letters of credit totaling $13.0 million at December 31, 2004. Fair
value of these letters of credit approximates their face value at December 31, 2004.

NOTE 12. SEGMENT INFORMATION

FCX follows SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,”
which requires that companies disclose segment data based on how management makes decisions
about allocating resources to segments and measuring their performance. FCX has two operating
segments: “mining and exploration” and “smelting and refining.” The mining and exploration
segment includes the copper and gold mining operations of PT Freeport Indonesia in Indonesia and
FCX’s Indonesian exploration activities. The smelting and refining segment includes Atlantic
Copper’s operations in Spain and PT Freeport Indonesia’s equity investment in PT Smelting in
Gresik, Indonesia. The segment data presented below were prepared on the same basis as the
consolidated FCX financial statements.

Through its operating subsidiaries, FCX markets its products worldwide primarily pursuant to
the terms of long-term contracts. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, revenues under long-
term contracts totaled approximately 96 percent in 2004 and 95 percent in 2003 and 2002. The only
customer under long-term contracts with over ten percent of revenues in at least one of the past
three years is PT Smelting with 29 percent in 2004, 23 percent in 2003 and 20 percent in 2002.

NOTE 13. SUPPLEMENTARY MINERAL RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

Proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying
and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully discussed below. The
term “reserve,” as used in the reserve data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit
which can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve
determination. The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from
dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are
computed from the result of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and
measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size,
shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term “probable reserves”
means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for
proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced.
The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume
continuity between points of observation.

66
All of PT Freeport Indonesia’s current aggregate (including Rio Tinto’s share) proven and
probable reserves, shown below, are located in Block A of PT Freeport Indonesia’s Contract of Work.
The initial term of the Contract of Work covering Block A expires at the end of 2021. PT Freeport
Indonesia can extend this term for two successive 10-year periods, subject to the approval of the
Indonesian government, which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. PT Freeport Indonesia’s
reserve amounts reflect its estimates of the reserves that can be recovered before the end of 2041
(the expiration of the two 10-year extensions). PT Freeport Indonesia’s current mine plan has been
developed and its operations are based on receiving the two 10-year extensions. As a result, PT
Freeport Indonesia does not anticipate the mining of all of its reserves prior to the end of 2021 based
on its current mine plan, and there can be no assurance that the Indonesian government will approve
the extensions. Prior to the end of 2021, under its current mine plan PT Freeport Indonesia expects

55 percent of its share of recoverable copper reserves and approximately 69 percent of its share of
recoverable gold reserves.

a. Reflects FCX’s 90.6 percent ownership interest (see Note 2).

Estimated recoverable reserves were assessed using a copper price of $0.85 per pound, a
gold price of $270 per ounce and a silver price of $5.00 per ounce. With respect to the proven and
probable reserves presented above, if metal prices were adjusted to the approximate average
London spot prices for the past three years, i.e., copper prices adjusted from $0.85 per pound to
$0.94 per pound and gold prices adjusted from $270 per ounce to $361 per ounce, the additions to
proven and probable reserves would not be material to reported reserves.

Incremental cash flow attributable to the fourth concentrator mill expansion is shared 60
percent by PT Freeport Indonesia and 40 percent by Rio Tinto (Note 2). Incremental cash flow
consists of amounts generated from production in excess of specified annual amounts based on the
December 31, 1994, reserves and mine plan. The incremental revenues from production from the
expansion and total revenues from production from Block A, including production from PT Freeport
Indonesia’s previously existing operations, share proportionately in operating, nonexpansion capital
and administrative costs. PT Freeport Indonesia receives 100 percent of cash flow from its existing

67
pre-expansion production facilities as specified by the contractual arrangements. PT Freeport
Indonesia’s estimated net share of recoverable reserves and FCX’s equity interest in those reserves
follow:
